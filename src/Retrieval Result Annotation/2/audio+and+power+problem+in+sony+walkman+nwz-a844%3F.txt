<con><sentence>
<sentcont> I opted for this product having owned previously a very reliable Sony MP3 player (NW E405) which utilised Sony's excellent Sonic Stage software</sentcont>
<sentcont>And I am brand loyal too, owning a number of Sony products</sentcont>
<sentcont>But this player runs off the rubbish Microsoft media player which as far as I can see cannot be stopped from putting annoying breaks in conjoined tracks</sentcont>
<sentcont>That's my only real problem with this product   but if I'd known this, I would have bought an i pod instead</sentcont>

<sentcont> I made my decision based on plenty of reviews talking of excellent sound quality</sentcont>
<sentcont>I was not dissappointed</sentcont>
<sentcont>After all, you buy a music player to LISTEN to and not to look at or fiddle with the gimmicks which may be included</sentcont>
<sentcont>The radio is great too</sentcont>
<sentcont>The supplied headphones create an excellent sound with plenty of bass and you can tweak the sound to your own personal preference</sentcont>
<sentcont>It may not be quite as thin as an iPod but it is hardly bulky and you can play music from any source</sentcont>
</sentence></pro>

<sentcont> Not so much a bad point as an area for improvement   I would have liked to see the radio have RDS or even DAB</sentcont>

<reviewtitle>the best i ever had</reviewtitle>
<rating>1.0</rating>
<freereview><sentence><sentcont>The first word that came out of my mouth when I listened to a track on this MP3 / Video player was WOW!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The sound quality that this tiny little device generates is just amazing.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>When it comes to MP3 players, I'm VERY picky.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I look for a device that gives me rich, crystal clear, high quality sound... with BASS!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>And this Walkman delivers it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>That's not to say that other brands don't deliver high-quality crystal clear sound, but at the same time, not all brands deliver it with outstanding bass and balance.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>At least, not for this price range.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The equalizer on this Sony Walkman is just perfect, as far as I'm concerned.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>When you crank up the bass level, you get exactly that - thick, solid bass, without distorting the earphones or affecting the treble.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>You can either select the presents that are pre-loaded in this device, or customize the frequency levels until you reach your desired sound.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>At 4GB, this Walkman can hold approximately 900 songs if they are at 128 kbps in MP3 format.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But personally, I would highly recommend you rip your MP3s from your CDs to 192 kbps, which would pretty much give you CD quality.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The downfall is that you won't be able to load 900 songs.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Since 192 kbps files are a little larger than 128 kbps, you'll be looking at something like 600 songs or so (assuming they are the standard 3 to 4 minute songs), which is still a lot.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>As for the video player, I was quite impressed with both the picture and, of course, sound quality.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The videos don't freeze up or skip or anything like that, they play just as smoothly as what you see on your television screen at home.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Importing audio, video, and images onto this device is pretty easy.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Simply connect one end of the USB cable (which comes included) to your Sony Walkman, and the other end of the cable to your computer.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Then, on your computer, go to Start, My Computer, look for the "Sony Walkman" drive, double click on it and then drag / drop your files in the appropriate folders.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The other option is to use Windows Media Player 11 (which you can download for free on the Internet) to synchronize your files to your Sony Walkman.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This is probably the better option if you want everything neatly organized.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It may take a little bit of practice for some, but it's fairly easy to do once you get the hang of it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>IMPORTANT NOTE: This review is written specifically for the NWZ-A815 model, not the NWZ-E436F series (BIG DIFFERENCE!).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Sony screwed up royally with the MWZ-E436F series as the sound quality is nowhere near as good.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Heck, I had a SanDisk Sansa that actually sounded better than the MWZ-E436F series.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The problem is that the MWZ-E436F walkmans come with cheap, very standard earphones and have very limited sound enhancement options.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I know this from personal experience as I purchased an E436 series thinking it's the same as the A815 series.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I was VERY disappointed.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Since the NWZ-A815 looks like it's discontinued, I would recommend you invest in the Sony NWZ-A726 instead to get that superior sound quality.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Summary for the NWZ-A815 Sony Walkman: Pros:  Amazing sound quality Excellent Equalizer Ridiculously long lasting battery Ultra slim design (less than half an inch thick) Has FM Radio Great bass!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Cons: Memory not expandable No voice recorder  This is an excellent product.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I highly recommend it.</sentcont></sentence>
