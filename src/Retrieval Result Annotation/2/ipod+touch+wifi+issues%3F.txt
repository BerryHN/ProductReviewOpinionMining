<freereview><sentence><sentcont>I have been in love with the ipod ever since I first got a first generation ipod nano way back in 2005.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Ever since then I have been satisfied with the product.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I have been thinking about getting an ipod touch for about 6 months.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>My ipod nano ran out of space and I wanted an ipod with bigger space.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So I have been researching the ipod touch for sometime now.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Luckily waiting this long the 2nd generation touch came out as well as a drop in price.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I purchased the 32g and after 4 days of playing with it, am greatly satisfied.The</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>graphics quickly caught my eye.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I love the wifi and haven't ran into any wifi problems like some of the other reviews have mentioned.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Youtube looks great and I love watching videos on the touch.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>There are a ton of downloadable applications that make the touch even better.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Even though the speaker quality could be better, it is still a great feature and I listen to my music without headphones a lot.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I love the album artwork and genius is great.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Even though you need a lot of music on your ipod for genius to work, its a great feature.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I was surprised at how accurate genius was and the great thing about it is its new so it will only get better after more people get itunes.I have seen a lot of cons about not having a camera.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Remember guys this is an ipod, and even though that feature would be nice, we must remember what the ipod is for: Music.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>All of the other features are just perks (Great perks, but perks).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Eventually I think apple will add other features in future ipods but this ipod 2nd generation touch beats the competition.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Since I had my ipod I really haven't even listened to much music due to the many other things it does.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I'm still in the process of figuring everything out but this new technology is scary.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I can't even imagine what future ipods will be like.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>My only complaint is safari wont let you download flash player.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It would have been nice to have been able to do this and this was the only reason that I didn't give the touch a perfect score.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Never the less I have internet on my phone so Im not missing out on too much.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Overall I would recommend this product to anyone who could afford it and really either size will be fine.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If you are looking for a great mp3 player that does tons of other things, this is the product for you.</sentcont></sentence>

<sentence><sentcont>Photo gallery: Apple iPod Touch (third generation)Photo gallery:Apple iPod Touch (third generation) Now in its third year, Apple's iPod Touch has evolved so many features and uses beyond media playback that we're not really sure what to call it anymore.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Some flock to the Touch for its first-class mobile Web browser and e-mail support, while others see it primarily as a portable gaming device, and some still pick it up for good old-fashioned music and video playback.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>No matter how you choose to define the iPod Touch, Apple's third-generation version has arrived, flaunting 8GB, 32GB, and 64GB capacities priced respectively at $199, $299, and $399.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Its hardware design hasn't changed dramatically from the model we reviewed in 2008, but neither has its status as the world's most feature-packed portable media player.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>DesignFor better or worse, the first thing we noticed about the third-generation iPod Touch is how unchanged it looks.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Side by side with the second-generation iPod Touch, you'd be hard-pressed to find a way to distinguish the two models from each other.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Aside from minor differences in the etching on the back of the Touch, the second- and third-generation models are spitting images of each other Just like its phone-wielding sibling, the iPhone, the iPod Touch is a touch-screen device with a glass-covered 3.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>5-inch screen that sports a 480x320-pixel resolution.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In spite of its touch-screen interface, Apple includes a few physical buttons, including a slim volume control on the left edge, a hold switch on the top, and a home button on the face of the player, placed below the screen.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The bottom edge of the Touch includes the same universal dock port and 3.5-millimeter headphone jack as previous models, piercing the otherwise unbroken expanse of chromed steel that wraps around the back and edges of the device.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The shape and dimensions of the Touch also remain unchanged (4.3 inches tall by 2.4 inches wide 0.33 inch thick), defined by a flat-glass front set inside a curved steel backing that feels natural in the hand but makes the iPod a little wobbly when you set it down on a table.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Packaged with the Touch is an Apple universal dock connector USB cable, a pair of white earbuds that include a microphone and remote control on the cable, and a molded universal dock insert to use with any charging or speaker accessories.</sentcont></sentence>

<sentence><sentcont>updates to the iPod Touch's design are subtle, but the hardware has definitely changed for the better.</sentcont></sentence>

<con><sentence>
<sentcont> Forced iTunes integration, iinability to Drag-n-Drop files as YOU see fit, inability to transfer your own photos to somebody else's (or your own) PC / Laptop </sentcont>
</sentence></con>
<freereview><sentence><sentcont>Firstly, I think they undersell this by calling it an MP3 or MP4 player - it is so much more.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Yes, it can do those things, but for me it has become more of a pocket internet device, a living atlas, phonebook / addressbook, contact database, PDA and a portable lifelink to email, weather (in any city) and just about everything else.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Heck, I practically forgort this thing does music and video (and haven't really missed them either).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The APPs ... this is one of the most entertaining and interesting things.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>You can get or buy an app for just about every conceivable function and frill - need a flashlight?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Get an app ... need to know where to find the nearest El Polo Loco?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Get an app ... want to track every move of your favorite sports franchise in real time?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Get an app ... I've been able to to find apps that help me edit my photos, build a contact list that interfaces with my maps & email addresses - and a lot of other niceties.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Yes, much of this is frivolous, but fun nonetheless.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>With more than a handful of usefull app-add-ons (and a ton of frivolous-but-fun ones), I've fashioned this iPod into a pocket instrument I'd rather not live without.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I absolutely love being able to pop into any coffee shop (or McDonalds) and quickly connnect to the internet - check my email or maybe surf a little; and all this without having to pull the laptop out of the trunk & pop it open.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I love being able to pull up an APP, ask for the nearest steakhouse (or dentist), and not only getting a list (sorted my distance) - but a map and satellite / sidewalk view of it, along with the phone number and website URL.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Ironically, it's turned out to be one of my least favorite music and video devices - because I'm fed up with iTunes and the forced synching methods they impose.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I love the videos, and the large screen makes it great for photo browsing, so I've probably got about twenty or thirty videos on it (and a ton of photos).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>That, and a handful of songs.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>One thing I'd recommend for those considering a purchase - go ahead and fork out for a quality screen protector.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I got the one of the best (and most expensive) one out there.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's been worth every dime because they are everything they claim to be.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Radio - The Touch gives you unlimited Radio of every possible genre.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Yes, you need to be in Wifi range for this, but it's fantastic and fun.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>At home, I actually use this to stream internet radio to my home system - from my home PC to my Touch - and the Touch plugged-in to the AUX input of my home audio system.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>All you need is a well-chosen radio app (and there are tons of them).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>You'll find plenty of excellent (free and paid) apps for radio streaming; most of which will allow you to access hundreds of stations, of every conceivable genre.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The paid apps in this category range from 99 cents to a few dollars, all worth it in my view.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Shopping - yes, (free) shopping apps for this and it makes it easy to log in for a quick check and easy purchase, from where ever you happen to be.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>As to email, I've found a nice, tight integration with my yahoo mail account .... which is also integrated seamlessly with my flickr photostream.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Fantastic!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Note of Interest ... I love how online reviews always slam the heck out of apple competitors, etc, whenever they review an 8GB mp3/mp4 player ... "A ridiculously limited" amount ... "pathetically low storage for a video player", etc.; yet they never say these things when reviewing an 8GB iPod.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Well, I'm here to say that 8GB is just as little (or as much) with an ipod ... but that in this case, it matters even less to me.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This device cost me around $230, and for the reasons explained here, was worth every thin dime!</sentcont></sentence>

</sentence></con>
<freereview><sentence><sentcont>I had purchased my first generation Touch a week before this new second generation was released, but I was able to return it to my local Target.Physical</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>SpecsThe entire front is just a beautiful, big, 3 in.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>screen.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>There are only three buttons, a small circular home button on the front, useful volume controls on the left side, and a power button on the top.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It is only 8.5 mm thin, 4.3 in.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>in height, 2.4 in.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>in width, and 4.05 oz.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Although thicker than the first generation, the contoured edges and curves, it feels even thinner and feels better to grasp.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>On the back there is Apple's signature aluminum backing that wraps around the front for a nice chrome bezel.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I was disappointed at first for replacing the nice dark rim, but the new rim is thinner and looks better than the iPhone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>On the upper left there is a newly shaped Wi-Fi antenna.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It is shaped like a oval and is more attention grabbing to me.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Although you can see yourself with the reflective backing, after a week of use, you won't be able to.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Even putting it on any surface, the back will gain a couple scratches.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Coupled with the greasy smudges produced by your fingers, the backing is a sight for sore eyes after a month of use.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I suggest an invisible shield.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I remember watching scratch test videos online for the indestructible first generation screen.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I was amazed.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I was soon amazed with the screen so I never put a screen protector on.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>There were no scratches.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Unfortunately after a week I got the second generation iPod Touch, there was already a scratch.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>No biggie, right?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's very small and all, but if you go to a bright graphic, it clearly deteriorated the screen around it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The home button also has a much cheaper feel.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The click feels completely different, and the sound it produces does not sound good.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>On the side there are volume controls that are quite helpful.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Unfortunately, they are not very easy to click.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Interestingly, if the iPod is switched to landscape mode, the volume controls don't switch with the direction.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In other words, when tilted, the left volume control would raise the volume, and the right volume control lowers it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I wouldn't think of it as a bad thing though, just personal preference.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>At the bottom there is a USB connector for syncing and charging, and one headphone jack.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>There is also an internal speaker that seems to have audio coming from the USB connector.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Software and PerformanceWith a mobile version of OS X, it is just like the iPhone without the phone features.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Released with the new product was software version 2.1.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Everything is done by navigating with touch, and is very simple and fun to use.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Multi-touch is also possible on the BEAUTIFUL screen made of glass.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Audio is average by headphones, but only if the dreadful provided earbuds are replaced.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The internal speaker doesn't sound like complete crap, but is so quiet, the only way to hear it is to have no ambient noise.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Video quality is beautiful and sharp.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Movies, TV shows, and music videos can be bought from iTunes at reasonable prices.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>An Application store was released from software version 2.0, and allows further customization with applications such as games, utilities, and many other possibilities.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Official game licenses release games, like EA, THQ, and Namco.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Games are full-length, and sometimes look very nice.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The Accelerometer is sometimes used to a fun advantage, and touch is mostly how everything is done.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Applications range from many types, such as: Books, Business, Education, Entertainment, Finance, Games, Healthcare and Fitness, Lifestyle, Music, Navigation, News, Photography, Productivity, Reference, Social Networking, Sports, Travel, Utilities, and Weather.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Unfortunately, developers of these applications can only configure things inside the application, and nothing to change the actual operation of anything outside the application.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>These apps definitely make this a deal-maker.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Battery life is very good, rated life of 36 hours of audio, and 6 hours for video.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>There are also preloaded applications, such as: Mail, Calender, Clock, YouTube, Photos, Weather, Maps, Stocks, Calculator, Notes, Contacts, The App Store, and the iTunes Store.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>All do what their names inform you of.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Safari is very useful, but only if you have a Wi-Fi connection.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Mail is just POP or IMAP email that is OK, but is not viewable by landscape.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>YouTube is just YouTube, but doesn't feature EVERY SINGLE video.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Although I'd say 99% of YouTube's database of videos will be found on this Wi-Fi application.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>iTunes Store is a Wi-Fi music store, and the App Store is the mobile Application Store.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>ConclusionIf you have the iPod Classic and have the money, I would still definitely recommend this media device.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>With so many features, I wouldn't consider it as just an MP3 player.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Although it does have some build faults, I REALLY recommend the 2nd generation iPod Touch.It is a totally unique iPod with a plethora of features, combining simplicity and innovation to a revolutionary level.</sentcont></sentence>

<reviewtitle>Much more than an mp3 player!</reviewtitle>
<rating>1.0</rating>
<pro><sentence>
<sentcont> Can't live without it, Does everything!, Can access the internet, Sleek, Easy to use, Fun </sentcont>
</sentence></pro>
<con><sentence>
<sentcont> No camera, Scratches easily., relies on router too much </sentcont>
</sentence></con>
<freereview><sentence><sentcont>First of all I will provide some background info about myself.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I live in a small town (between 5,000 and 6,000 people).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I also have a 19 month old toddler.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I'm planning on buying a membership to the local gym to help get rid of my post pregnancy tummy and tone up my muscles.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>That's what started my obsession with the iPod touch.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I need music to listen to while I work out so I began researching mp3 players online.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I did A LOT of research and I finally came to the conclusion that this is the best product for your money - especially if you want an item that will do it all.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If you just want something to play your music, then this isn't for you.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But if you want something to play music, videos, view photos, play games, read email, go online, access your contacts, tell you about the weather, and many more things...then this is your music player!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Now, I'm not rich - far from it!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>And I don't have any credit cards or anything like that.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So I was deffinitely freaked out by the price.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I bought mine for $225 from a licensed Apple retailer.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I was tempted to buy from ebay but I've gotten some bad products from sellers who had decent reputations.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So, needless to say, I was a little leery.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I'd rather spend more and get a product that is guaranteed to work and won't be "lost during shipping".I only purchased the 8gb model.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I'm not planning on downloading any videos to it and I don't have a huge mp3 music library.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But if you want to download videos or movies onto the iPod's memory or if you have a huge music collection, I would deffinitely suggest getting a model with more memory.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I sometimes wish I'd bought the 16gb model but I think the 8gb will be sufficient.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>As for the iPod itself...all I can say is WOW.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It is absolutely amazing.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It can do everything that the iPhone can do except it doesn't have the phone part built in and it doesn't have a camera.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So it's perfect for people who WANT an iPhone but aren't on the AT&T network.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I use my iPod as a music player, an organizer, a scientific calculator, a weight loss tracker, a GPS direction device, an encyclopedia, a game console, a weather checker, an email checker, and to access the internet.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>And there are more applications you can download (many are FREE!) to turn your iPod into something else.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I've seen apps to turn your device into a leveler, social networking apps...if you can think of it, there's probably an app for it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>You can even access the iTunes store and pay for and download music directly to your iPod.It's only shortcoming is that you have to have wireless internet to access all of the features.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Wireless routers aren't too expensive so it's not a big deal but it does kinda stick for those people who would have to buy one.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>And you have to have internet access to hookup your router as well, if you didn't know.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>A cable connection is best.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>My router goes up to 400 feet and it cost me about $40.When I bought my iPod, I was afraid that the apps would be expensive and that I'd be tempted to buy a lot of them.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>However, many of them are free.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>A lot of the free apps are considered "light" or demo versions - but they're almost as good as the ones you have to buy.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The only app I payed for was a game and it cost me 0.99.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I have an app for wikipedia, The Weather Channel, Lose It! (a weight loss helper), WebMD, Solitaire, and a couple games.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>There are many free apps that are useful and entertaining.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>For example, you can get apps for MySpace, FaceBook...you can even download an app that will help you make VoIP calls from your iPod (with the help of a headset with mic.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>At first, I did wonder if I'd spent too much on a glorified mp3 player.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But after using it in my day-to-day life, it was worth it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I don't regret it at all.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I can actually check my email if my daughter is awake - I can't with my computer (a laptop) because she tries to grab it and push buttons and it's too difficult.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I can easily check directions if I'm having trouble finding something.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I can look up phone numbers and information online if I'm trying to find a product that I need to buy but can't find it in stock.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I can check symptoms with WebMD.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I can organize my life with the calendar.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I can do my homework with the scientific calculator.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I can listen to my music.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I can listen to audio books.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I can do pretty much anything with this device!It really is worth it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So if you've been thinking about buying one for awhile and you're still on the fence - just do it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>You won't regret it!A lot of people think that it sucks that you have to use iTunes.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But you don't have to buy the music from them!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>You can use Limewire or whatever and then just add it to your iTunes library.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It does scratch easily but that can be solved if you buy a case for it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I bought a hard shell case - the front part is aluminum and the back is clear.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It also comes with a screen protector so that the touch screen doesn't get scratched up.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's worked well for me so far.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>My only issue with it is that it doesn't have a camera.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I think, for the price you pay, it should have at least a 3 megapixel camera like what most cell phones have.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But other than that, this is a great little device and well worth it!ALSO: If you are having problems accessing your Yahoo! email account from your touch, this is what I did to fix my problem.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I kept getting errors saying that the account couldn't be verified or that my username and/or password were incorrect.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>First, delete the yahoo account info by going to settings->mail->account->delete.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Then turn off the iPod buy holding down the sleep/wake button until a red slider pops up.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Slide the slider.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Go online, LOG OUT of your yahoo account.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Turn your iPod back on and enter in your email account settings again.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>You won't need to repeat this everytime you need to check your yahoo email on your touch, just the first time was enough for me.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Just make sure you log out online or you won't be able to view it on your touch!If you are having problems with your YouTube app running, you may need to return your iPod to the store and get a new one.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>My friend could NOT get hers to work no matter what she did and when she got a replacement iPod, it worked fine.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It may just be a flaw in the device.If</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>you are having problems with iTunes, make sure you don't have any proxies running in ANY of your internet applications, especially Internet Explorer.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I use Firefox and had no proxies running on there, but I guess proxies were on my Internet Explorer so I was having all kinds of connectivity issues.Hope this helped someone!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If I have any more tips/tricks I'll add them later.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I did NOT buy mine online but you can find this product at many online retailers (Amazon, Apple Store (Free engraving), PC Connection (cheapest)) and in many brick-and-mortar stores (wal-mart, Target, Kmart, etc)If you have any questions about this product or about my review, please let me know!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Leave me a comment or send me a message and I'll get back to you asap.</sentcont></sentence>

<reviewtitle>Almost Perfect</reviewtitle>
<rating>0.8</rating>
<pro><sentence>
<sentcont> Easy to use, Sleek, Fun, Quality, Fits right in your back pocket., very good looking </sentcont>
</sentence></pro>
<con><sentence>
<sentcont> No camera, Scratches easily., no radio without WiFi </sentcont>
</sentence></con>
<freereview><sentence><sentcont>I have to admit that there have been few items that have captured and kept my enthusiasm for as long as the iPod Touch.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Two years ago, I purchased the original Touch, last year I upgraded to the 32 GB, and now I have the 64GB version.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Was the upgrade worth it?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>And what are the things yet to be imroved?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Because even though the Touch is close to perfection, there are still many small things that can be improved.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Hardware Physically, the new (64GB) Touch is identical to it's 2nd generation brethren.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's polished crome backplate is slightly curved, making it fit your palm perfectly.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>As before, the fact that it's made from polished chrome will guarantee that it attracts fingerprints and scratches almost magically.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I'm no friend of any kind of protective covers, and my last (32GB) Touch had to live in my pocket with my keys, coins, and other stuff I threw in with it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>After a year, the backplate did pick up a lot of scratches, and I expect that the 64GB to fare no better.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Personally, I would have preferred a brushed finish for the backplate.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This may have caused problems with the readability of the customized engraving that Apple applies to the Touch on the backplate for no additional charge (a nice 'touch' that becomes increasingly important as the Touch becomes more ubiquitious).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This custom engraving you can only get if you order the Touch through Apple (it's also not available in the Apple Stores).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The front plate is made from one of the most impressive glass enhancements I've ever seen.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>After a year of heavy abuse, my old Touch's glass front has not a single scratch - not one.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I don't know how Apple does it, but this is really impressive.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Remember, I don't use any protective covers or films.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The screen itself is brilliant, bright, and can easily be read outside, wich is a feat in itself.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The Touch has an ambient light sensor, so it can dim the screen when the surroundings are darker.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This time around, the screen's color temperature has remained unchanged (the 2G shifted all colors from a blueish to a more golden tinge).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Movie playback is simply astonishing.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The image is crisp, and the on-screen controls natural.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Again, there are niceties such as double-tapping the screen to change aspect ratio, or placing bookmarks etc.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>You still can't set a movie's contrast, but beyond that small issue, movie playback is perfect.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Viewing movies on the Touch simply works great, but personally I think that the screen is too small to watch a full movie.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Last week, I tried watching a TV episode while on a plane enroute to Hamburg (a 75 minute flight), but quickly decided against it, opting instead to play a game of 'Luxor'.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Somehow I prefer a larger screen for consuming video, while I have no problems doing something interactive on it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Still, video plays great on the Touch.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Button and interface lay-out has remained the same from the last generation: volume controls on the left side, top holds the 'exit/on' button, buttom has dock and phones connectors, and the front holds the single home button.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>There is one thing that can be improved here: I would have preferred the audio connector to be on top (or either side), as the current configuration precludes the use of many applications (e.g. News- and eBook readers) when you want to place it upright -- for example in the Gym.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Some apps do use the accelerometers and can be used positioning the Touch upside down, though.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The built-in speaker is unchanged from the last version.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's weak, tinny, mono, produces horrible sound, has no volume to speak of -- and yet it's one of the best additions to the Touch (the original didn't have it, the 2nd gen did).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It simply makes casual gaming so much more fun.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I don't care about the bad sound quality, I just love the fact that it's there.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The signatory white earphones that Apple sells with the Touch may look good, but I don't like them.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In my ears they are too uncomfortable.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Since I'm no audiophile, I can't comment on their audio quality other than that it's good enough for me.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Anyway, I replaced them with my favorite non-Apple version.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The hitch here is that Apple now delivers the 64 GB (and 32 GB) with earphones that sport a built-in mic and remote.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>And my head phones don't have that.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>While the remote is nothing much to write home about (the way it works is just too complex), the mic works well, and has just the right fidelity to pick out voice over the background noise.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So, for now, I keep the white buds with me in case I want to use the IP-telephony capabilities.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Battery life appears to have been reduced somewhat from the 2nd gen - at least on paper.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>During the past few days the new 3rd gen Touch certainly performed as well as or even better than my 2nd gen - but then again, that one's battery is already one year old.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>One fact that I've become very fond of is the quick-charge ability, which works really well.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The built-in wireless connectivity is really nice, with astonishingly well executed integration.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The touch does all it's wireless networking over WiFi and Bluetooth.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>WiFi works really well (especially here in Switzerland where Hotspots are particularely dense), and Bluetooth integration (which I tried on the 3rd gen for the first time) is flawless.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>WiFi reception (range) lags somewhat behind that of a Wintel laptop (no doubt due to the metal backplate) and is pretty much on par with that of a 15" Macbook Pro (which is also somewhat lacking in WiFi reception range).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>WiFi is still the 'g' variant though [interestingly enough, the built-in hardware does support 11n, but so far Apple has chosen not to activate it, presumably to conserve battery.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This is interesting also from the fact that in the 2G Touch, Apple initially included Bluetooth capabilities, but only activated it with a later OS release.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Perhaps the same can be expected for 11n].</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Bluetooth now also works with headphones and BT-based car integration kits (works well in mine).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I would have loved to try out BT-based printing from the Calender or Addressbook app, but hit a snag: it appears no Touch app supports printing.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Missing Hardware There is some hardware that I expected, or whished that it was included in the Touch - especially as (some) of them are now present on other iPods: No camera.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I was somewhat ambivalent about this.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>No camera means no pictures and/or movies.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But it also means that I can keep handling it rough, as I do not have to worry abou the lens.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Also, I don't have to worry about taking it to the Gym (my Gym has very strict rules towards camera-equipped items).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>All things being equal, the addition of a camera (still and/or video) would have been nice, but I don't miss it much (truth be told, I yet have to use the camera on my mobile phone).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Unfortunately, there is also no built-in mic.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This is much a more significant omission than having no camera.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The Touch is a first class audio voice recorder and (more importantly for me) a first class Skype client.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>There are third party solutions for this (a mini-micro that directly plugs into the headphone connector), but if the touch had a built-in mike, it would make using world-class applications like Shazam (and Skype) so much easier Likewise, there is no compass, nor a GPS receiver present in the touch.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I understand that these are left out to better differentiate the Touch from the iPhone, but I would have welcomed them in the top-of-the-line (64GB) version of the iPod.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>And, finally, there is no radio receiver.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I'm definitely not a radio man, as I next to never listen to it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Still, some people do (as the ton of nicely selling IP radio applications shows), and anyway, the Nano has it now - even with a nice Tivoesque pause feature!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Why not the Touch?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Strange design choice.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Internet While by itself the iPod Touch is an impressive and fun device, it comes into real swing when connected to the internet.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The always-on nature and graceful handling of connection drops make the Touch one of the best internet devices I've used to day.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The included Safari internet browser performs great - unless you try to load Flash-based content, which is not supported.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The email client works great for receiving and viewing mail.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Writing anything but the shortest of email is annoying, as the Touch is simply too small for comfortably entering any significant amount of text.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Calendar and Address Book are well executed (even if entering a new date and merging multiple calenders is slightly more convoluted than necessary).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Mail, Calendar and Addressbook can (if you have that service available) synch live to either mobile me (which Apple loves to sell you) or Exchange (which your employer loves to force on you) through a feature that is very similar to 'push' notification.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In the past, using Exchange has been somewhat spotty, and mobile Me has had it's own share of problems.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>All in all, though both work nice, and exceedingly quick.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>You do need to be in range of a hotspot for this to function, though.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Somewhat disappointing is the fact that notes are not synched.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Another nice addition is 'Voice Memos' which is an audio recorder.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Had the Touch an internal mic, this app would have been even better... Applications Next to the 'productivity' or 'PDA' suite (Mail, Calendar, Contacts) the touch comes with some other nice (but somewhat dull) apps (e.g. Maps, Stocks, YouTube) and two killer Apps: iTunes and App Store.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>While the former gives you instant access to all songs and movies that are currently available on iTunes (Warning: that, plus the incredible 'Shazam' can lead to unintented gross music spending), the latter (App Store) gives you equal instant access to an incredible number of applications that you can instantly download and use.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The quality of applications on the App Store is quite uneven, and tends to cluster around some rather puerile topics (as a veritable, uh, heap, of Fart applications proves).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>That being said, there are a number of jaw-droppingly good applications that are able to utilize the touch interface (and other capabilities such as accelerometer) in new and surprising ways.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Just to name a few are the aforementioned 'Shazam' that can identify a song being played and instantly link to iTunes (you have to see it in action to believe it), Flight Control, where you manage an airport by drawing the flight path for each plane.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Bloomberg that provides stock information in an exhaustive way, and Wemlin that shows an up-to-date timetable for when the next tram arrives at my station.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>No matter what, there probably is an application that supports you with it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>And then there are games.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Apple had quickly recognized that the Touch represents an immensely attractive and powerful game platform.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Performance, screen, connectivity and control capabilities make it the ideal casual gaming platform.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Accordingly, games represent by far the largest category in the App store.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>While inevitably there are some truly awfully executed, or simply dull games, the majority of the available games are at least somewhat entertaining, while some rival and exceed those that can be had for thrice the price on dedicated gaming platforms.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In the past, my Touch quickly filled up with app after app that I simply couldn't live without any more, and an unforseen limitation of the Touch's design surfaced: app management.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Applications are arranged as icons on a 4x4 grid per page, with multiple pages that you can flick left and right to navigate.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Unfortunately, re-arranging apps, although possible (and quite ingeniously implemented) is still a chore.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Apple has done the right thing, and integrated a much nicer app manager into the (PC/Mac) iTunes application.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Speed Improvement The iPod Touch, although seen by some as the 'iPhone's smaller sibling' was always either as nible as the phone, or even faster.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The new, 3rd gen Touch is said to be 'up to 50% faster' than the previous generation.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>To be honest, I'm not sure that I see that speed improvent translate to much performance increase.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>That may be due to the fact that my Touch seldom maxes out on processor throughput or (for example when browsing) that WiFi bandwidth is the limiting factor.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Some apps appear to be 'snappier' during start-up (smaller apps) or execution (games, mostly), but all in all, the Touch pretty much seems to be as fast as the last generation.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This leads me to believe that the real bottleneck is it's internal execution memory (i.e. not the 64 GB storage, but processor memory), and ony applications that are specifically written to take advantage of new technology (e.g. OpenGL ES).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Or in other words: the overall speed has not been improved that much.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>SDK So you want to be a geek?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Already are?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>You can write your own applications for the Touch if you like.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I've taken the plunge and downloaded the SDK.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Note that you can download the SDK and develop for the Touch/iPhone without actually owning one.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The development system comes with a iPhone simulator that you can use to test your applications without downloading them unto an actual device (it does have some limitations: for example, the accelerometers are not simulated, and you have no indication of the true execution speed).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Well, you do need a Mac for this (although it can be a few years old).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The SDK is impressive - overwhelming even if you are not used to Mac programming (and almost prohibitively complex if you are not used to frameworks like Cocoa and object-oriented programming).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Still, crunching out your first (very basic) appliction is surprisingly easy, and if you roll that way, you'll get addicted quickly.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Summary: It's the killer personal entertainment device.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Buy it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>You know you want it -- especially if you have read this far.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If you have the 2nd gen iPod, you may need to ask yourself if the slight speed bump and the additional storage is worth the hefty price tag.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>To me it was, but your mileage may vary.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>pros + world class touch/gesture interface + best iPod audiovisual experience around (music, video, photos).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>killer feature: app store and application availability + killer feature: internet integration (browsing and push technology) + great movie playback.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>really good casual gaming device + slightly improved speed (allegedly, only for some games) + great integration with mobile me (calender, mail sync) or Exchange.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>really good SDK if you are geeky enough to roll your own apps cons - no built-in mic (headphones do have them) - polished chrome backplate (I would have preferred a brushed finish).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>no gps, camera, compass - no radio (nano has it?) - no sync of notes, no wireless sync of music/movies.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>- spotty voice recognition in languages other than english - no control over downsampling of photos - no search function for music inside the iPod app - no visualizer.</sentcont></sentence>

</sentence></con>
<freereview><sentence><sentcont>The recent rage of Cell Phone land is, yes, that often mentioned, earth shattering invention known as the iPhone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>For a LOT of people that device became the device of choice, however, for many of us, we could not bring ourselves to move to AT&T, even for the greatest thing from Cupertino since, well, the Mac itself.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>For the rest of us, there is the iPod Touch.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This non iPhone clone is all the iPodish goodess of the phone without the celluar contracts.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It boasts the same size screen but comes in at almost half as thick as its iPhone big brother.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It has Audio and Video capabilities and even does the nifty "flip" thing the iPhone does to give you coverflow.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>With the Touch getting twice he storage capability at roughly the same price as the phone, it's a good trade off to only have 802.11g wireless capability.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>You have some apps from the iPhone to play with too.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>You have the calendar syncing capability which, for some unknown reason won't let you add events.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>(Update, this was "fixed" in the 1.1.2 firmware update.)</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>You also get Safari for browsing the web when you are near a WiFi hotspot.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Your Contacts and YouTube access are present as well.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>What's missing?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>How about Email?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Not on the Touch.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>You don't get Bluetooth access either, so no wireless headsets without an adapter.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Oh, and by the way, those video out cables you bought for your older Video iPod, don't even try it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Apple has decided to create a new "proprietary" cable setup which means you get to buy another set.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The iPod Touch uses the same operating system as the iPhone which means, you guessed it, the same hacks for the iPhone work here too.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I give you the same standard warnings here, however.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Modifing your Touch WILL void your warranty and you do run the REAL risk of turning it into an expensive brick.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>That being said, I have personally jailbroken my Touch and gone through a firmware update with little issues other than having to start over after each one.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It IS an iPod after all and a full restore is only a click away in iTunes.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Overall, the iPod Touch is an excellent iPod for those of use who do not want, or need the iPhone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I recommend it to anyone who doesn't desire to carry their entire media library with them and wants excellent screen resolution, clarity, and battery life.</sentcont></sentence>

<reviewtitle>I don't know how I lived before I got this product!</reviewtitle>
<rating>1.0</rating>
<pro><sentence>
<sentcont> surf the web, utilities, games, texting apps, touch screen, built in speaker, music in background of games or web </sentcont>
</sentence></pro>
<con><sentence>
<sentcont> No flash player support </sentcont>
</sentence></con>
<freereview><sentence><sentcont>So, let's begin:First - unless you've recently held a new 'Nano', you won't belive how thin the Touch is.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The glass surface feels different from my iPod Classic (yeah, I'm a *serious* MP3 player addict, and have that one, too).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I can't really put my finger on it (it's hard to resist puns like that), but it feels somewhat softer when tapping it with your finger nail.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Surprisingly (for me at least) the Touch does not respond to finger nails - you need to touch the surface with your finger's skin.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This can initially be confusing when you are used to pressure-sensitive touch-screens, and can become difficult when using the virtual keyboard.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The touch-sensitive font plate has (so far) proven to be scratch-resistant (i've been carrying it around in my pocket for the past three days).In</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>my hand it feels surprisingly hefty (sonsidering it's sleekness), and it is noticeably longer than the Classic.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Like most other iPods, the Touch has a polished backside that magically attract fingerprints.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This backplate also holds the customized engraving that Apple applied free of charge to my iPod.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The headphone connector is on the bottom, and accepts any normal headphone jack (unlike the iPhone).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The position of the connector would have been annyoing if you wanted to use it upright in a gym (natch, iPod nano!).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But movies are viewed in landscape orientation, and the iPod's interface automatically detects it's orientation.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Now that's design for you.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The earbuds are the same that come with other new iPods (classic).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>They are ok, but unlikely to be your first choice.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I use the those earbuds for running (with my shuffle), but third-party (B&O) earphones with the classic and touch.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I'm no audiophile, so sound quality usually is good for me (this holds true for all my devices).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But then, according to some people I'm only listening to trash anyway.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I therefore recommend that you look at other reviews if you are in search for a tone perfect device.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I like it.Controlling the iPod is a strange - great when you are looking at it, annoying if you can't see it (i.e. if it's in your pocket).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>As with all touch-interfaces that have no tactile feedback there is no way to 'blindly' control it, and sadly the Touch does not have a remote nor real buttons except 'sleep' and 'home'.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The Touch desperately needs some hardware volume control.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Looking at the screen I have to say that I am amazed at the clarity of the image.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>3.5 inches is still too small for me to comfortably watch a lengthy movie, but the 320x480 pixel wide-screen display is stunningly crisp.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I re-ripped some TV shows that I originally ripped for the Classic and watched them on the Touch.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The problem is that files ripped for the Touch's resolution are roughly twice as large as for the Classic - but the Touch has only a fraction of the available storage.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Thus, I can't envision myself using the Touch for lengthy movie watching - but it is excellent for watching shorter clips (while I'm no youTube fan, I do have a lot of short clips shot with my handheld camera).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The Touch's sceen is very bright - I can't confirm initial reports of 'inverse black' or other artifacts.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It appears to have a light sensor built-in that dims the screen when in darker surroundings, and brightens the screen when in the sun.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>One small annoyance though: there is no way to control a movie's contrast.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The docs claim that the Touch can play 5 hours of video on a single charge.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I'm prepared to take this on face value - I'm certainly not going to stare into that small screen for so long just to verify this.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's long enough for one-and-half normal movies, but won't last a transatlantic.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Nor would my eyes, though.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Coverflow is drop-dead beautiful, and a real show-off.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It requires that you add artwork for all your CD-ripped tunes, though.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Otherwise missing covers are replaced by generic grey ones.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's a great way to browse your music if you don't know what you want to hear next.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's a silly way to look for a particular album, though.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>For this, however, you can still (luckily) use the normal artist/album/song browser with the (again drop-dead intuitive) new gesture-based interface.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It works reall, really well.Like all iPods the Touch can play a large variety of file formats with the (expected) exceptions of WMA (protected and otherwise) and Ogg.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I don't have to add that it plays AAC protected (iTunes).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It can also display an impressive array of image and movie formats, even though I have the suspiction that some of the listed formats are transcoded on-the-fly by iTunes during sync.The Touch provides video out signals that can be set to either NTSC or PAL.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>For Europeans like me this is very important, but may be of limited use for people living in the US. What *really* annoyed me was the fact that Apple chose to change the video out cabling, and thus forced me to purchase new cables to connect the Touch to TV sets or beamers.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>WiFiThe Touch has 802.11b/g (but not 'n') WiFi built-in that can connect to the internet through normal hotspots.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Since you can expect the iPod to be in many different locations, hooking it up to hotspots is an important feature that must be easy to use.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The Touch can (and will) remember hotspots it has connected to, and asks when it connects to a new hotspot very much like your Laptop does.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Connecting to open Hotspots is a snap: scan surroundings, pick from list, (enter password when protected), connect.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>You can turn it off for airplane travel or to conserve battery life.You connect to protected hotspots (using the virtual keyboard for password entry).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Also you can use Safari for those annoying web-page-to-enter-billing-info based hotspots that hotels seem to like (and every one else hates).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Connecting to a closed and secure WLAN is a bit more complex.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>My WLAN is configured to require any device to be known by MAC address, and looking up this info wasn't as intuitive as I thought it would be (I found it in the Info tab).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I then entered Network Name and Password, and a few seconds later, my Touch had access to my WLAN.But what is so special about WiFi?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>To me, having access to the Web is a killer feature.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I'm not talking about music here - but access to Google (but not the Google Apps just yet), Wikipedia, CNN, Amazon, and my web mail account.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>With just a little tap on the screen I can look at news, check my mail, track a package, fire off a note to someone, or answer a silly question that just entered my head.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Anywhere, anytime (when in range of a hotspot.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In Switzerland that's practically everywhere).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>To repeat: this is a killer feature.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It turns this digital media player into a nearly fully fledged PDA.The Touch version of Safari is great (even though Google Docs does not yet support it, and there currently is no support for Flash), and very responsive.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Using the virtual keyboard takes some time to getting used to (again the missing tactile feedback is annoying).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Navigating the web is quick (provided you have a good connection), and using the gestures to move the obscured parts of web pages into view becomes natural after only a few moments.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Summary:The Touch is (currently) the best flash-based media player around, with a stunning (even revolutionary) new gesture-based user interface that works.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I would have welcomed a significantly larger main storage, but it's very good as it is now.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>As a media player it's main drawback derives from the purely touch-based interface: it could have profited from a tactive rotary controller for 'blind' control.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The feature that separates the Touch from the rest is the addition of another killer feature: WiFi web browsing.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>WiFi based music purchase is a nice bonus.The</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Touch also comes with a number of (sometimes artificial) limitations that I hope will be resolved in the future.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>All in all I'm very, very satisfied with the Touch, even though the Touch experience can clearly be improved (e.g. by removing application restrictions, being able to pull in shared iTunes Libraries, sharing songs wirelessly, syncing wirelessly etc.).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>PLUS- great "video" iPod- WiFi web browsing with Safari (killer feature)- wide range of supported file formats (audio, video, images)- great display- phenomenally sharp images- drop-dead gesture/touch interface- both NTSC and PAL video out (important for us Europeans).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>- iTunes store wirelessly- TV PAL and NTSC out MINUS- no playlist groups- difficult to use 'blind'- no contrast control for movies- no disk mode (huh.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>?)- non-standard AV connector (again!)- artificial limitations on Calendar application- no Mail, Notes, Games applications.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>can't access iTunes shared libraries on WLAN- can't share songs with other Touch iPods- no wireless synching.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>16GB can be awfully small when ripping movies for Touch's resolution- no WiFi iTunes PodCasts By C.</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>design: ??Apple's updates to the iPod Touch's design are subtle, but the hardware has definitely changed for the better.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>A slim volume switch now graces the left edge of the Touch, making it easier to make quick volume adjustments.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The chromed steel back of the second-generation iPod Touch now mimics the rounded design of the iPhone 3G, giving the device a slimmer profile at its edges.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Whether psychological or by design, the second-generation iPod Touch feels less fragile than last year's model and makes the plastic enclosure of the iPhone 3G feel cheap by comparison.Minor improvements aside, the second-generation iPod Touch hardware is largely unchanged.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Both the first- and second-generation iPod Touch share the same dimensions (4.3 inches by 2.4 inches by 0.31 inch), same glass-covered screen (3.5 inch), and same arrangement of headphone jack, dock connector, sleep button, and home button.</sentcont></sentence>

<reviewtitle>Awesome product... i just love it</reviewtitle>
<rating>0.9</rating>
<pro><sentence>
<sentcont> classy looking, great entertainment functions, great variety of applications in itune store, responsive, better battery life, build in speaker, volume control button (i hope the volume control button can do more than just controlling the volume) </sentcont>
</sentence></pro>
<con><sentence>
<sentcont> just reasonable sound quality from stock earphone (i expect more from a luxury entertainment tools), wifi sometimes has connection issues, can't read PDF, documents.</sentcont>
<sentcont>(i suppose it can, but conversions needed) </sentcont>
</sentence></con>
<freereview><sentence><sentcont>I owned an IPOD touch 1st GEN, i gave it away after i got the 2nd GEN.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>2nd GEN is a slimmer, better looking piece of gadget.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The integrated speakers and volume control buttons are highly desirable.. integrated speaker allows me to listen to my music when i am tiring of using earphone after long hours, volume control buttons allow easy access to volume (the most common use function) without switching on the screen, in a way it is conserving the battery.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>integration of various new applications are highly appreciated as well... now, i can use ipod to access the facebook, mailbox, map and etc.. it is so user friendly as the pages has been specifically designed for Ipod touch and Iphone... in addition, various free utilities applications have made my ipod my best companion as it just like a PDA (although not as good as a real PDA) that helps to organize my stuffs.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>My biggest disappointment in Ipod touch most probably is it can't read PDF and word documents.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Some have suggested some brilliant ideas so IPOD touch can read PDFs and word documents.... but from my point of view, this is just too tedious and complicated.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>i am hoping they will introduce new itune and applications that allow IPOD touch preview PDF file.lastly, stock earphone is just not good enough, pretty disappointed with the sound quality.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>just wondering why cant they provide a better pair of earphone?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>i end up spending extra money to buy a new pair of sennheiser.. well, it sounds a lot better now...=)giving it 4 and a half due to (1) cheaper (2) better applications (3) build in speaker (4) integrated volume control button (5) gorgeous looking i could have given 5 stars if it allows me read PDF and a better pair of earphone... =)... for those that have a worn-out IPOD touch 1st GEN, this definitely is a good upgrade...</sentcont></sentence>

<sentence><sentcont>Even while I was researching it online at Viewpoints and the Apple website, I thought it was a colossal waste of money.??</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>His Ipod Nano that is not even 2 years old was still in great shape and I didn't think the Ipod Touch would be that much better.I ended up buying the Ipod Touchon Apple's website because I was told that they do free engraving on the back of the Ipod and free gift wrap.??</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I thought that was a cute idea.??</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The price was the same on the website as it is in the stores sans the shipping.????</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I still didn't learn alot about theipod Touch on Apple's website so I was a little excited to see what it could do.I</sentcont></sentence>

<sentcont>Do we need these things</sentcont>
</sentence></con>
<freereview><sentence><sentcont>I also rec'd this thing for father's day, as a gift from my wife.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>What was she thinking?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>At 11 times what I spent on her for mother's day I was dumb-founded.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>As someone who NEVER, EVER wears headphones or uses his current MP3 player I was even more confused.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Even when I did use my Creative MuVo on my commute to work (when I HAD a job) I usually only listened to the radio, and I get sick watching video in a vehicle anyway.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I mean my wife has a 1st gen Touch and I have rarely picked it up or shown interest in it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So far I've had this device for a little over 3 weeks, I have lost hours of sleep deciding whether or not to return it... I am running out of time as I only have 3 more days.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>What to do?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I would have rather had a pneumatic nailer or something.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Oh and the worst feature... the easy unchecked internet access.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Yep I'm a recovering sex-addict, or at least I WAS until the Touch came along.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I had been 'sober' (after joining SAA) for almost four months, I hadn't looked at a single p0rn site on my computer or anywhere else, I had really cleaned up my act and stopped wasting so much of my precious time.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Then the Touch came along, sitting neatly on the bedside table, and hey guess what... there's all kinds of p0rn sites specifically designed for these mobile devices.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I succumbed to the temptation and months of hard work was thrown away in an instant.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I was mad at myself, mad at my wife and suddenly 100% opposed to the idea of my son getting one of these for his 13th birthday.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I haven't been to a meeting since...</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I am ashamed to have to admit to all those other men that I have failed and am again starting from zero.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I f__king hate the Touch, part of me wants to throw it on the floor and jump on it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But we're broke (another reason I didn't understand WHY on earth my wife would buy this for me) and the $280cdn she spent on it is needed.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>3 more days, I guess I should plug it in and hit RESTORE, polish the small scratches off the back and put it back in its poorly designed box that doesn't even stay closed.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I am so happy that I didn't unwrap the headphones, cable or cleaning cloth, should make returning it much easier.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Did I mention that I haven't listened to a single complete song on this thing?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>People need to wake up and realise how much of their lives they are wasting on useless bits of technology like the Touch.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Get outside, enjoy some fresh air, listen to what's going on around you instead of being constantly plugged in and unaware.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The money would be better spent on a bike, get out and ride.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>No wonder there's so much obesity.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Well I'm done now, I'm not sure if I feel better or just more angry about the whole thing.</sentcont></sentence>

<sentence><sentcont>Even though I didn't buy it, the price is finally not outrageous.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The music options are great.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Cover flow is great looking and you have itunes built right in if you ever have the urge to buy a song.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Photos look amazing on the touch.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Its fun to look through your pictures and its easy to resize them or change them.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Pictures can be easily taken from the internet or there are great apps that give you tons of wallpapers.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Videos look their best on the touch.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>From your own librabry of movies to clips on youtube, not many devices can compete with this.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The safari web browser looks like a real browser on this ipod.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It loads very fast and switches to landscape no problem.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Email is a piece of cake to use.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>With many different emails (yahoo, gmail, AOL, etc) built in, you can get to your inbox in nothing flat.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>And finally, the app store.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>With the app store, you can browse thousands of useful applitcations, many which are free.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The games are very fun, and not just the paid ones.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Apps like scribble and linerider are endless fun.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>There are apps like myspace, cnet, facebook, rss feeder and more.</sentcont></sentence>

<sentence><sentcont>Now the bad.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>There are very few things that can be done to improve this machine.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>One of things is fm radio.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I don't see why this isn't possible, it might just make the ipod a bit thicker.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The second thing is the back of the ipod.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This looks great... for the first five minutes.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If you don't buy a case, the back with be scratched and ugly in no time.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Apple has made every other ipod and the iphone lose this easy to scratch surface.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Brushed aluminum anyone?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Please fix this apple.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The last con is the need of itunes.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>And I know it sounds selfish, but come on, you know it would be amazing if you had the option (without using some program) to put files on it like a jumpdrive.</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>I purchased quite a few Ipods in my day from the Microsoft Zune to the ipod touch.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>??The Zune is not a great item due to the fact that it has no compatibility with an apple computer whatsoever while an ipod works easily on both the apple or a PC. ??The Apple Ipod Plugs in and Synchronizes music in a matter of minutes rather than hours.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>When I got the first ipod I was listening to music in about ten minutes when I got the Zune it took me hours how to figure out how to put music on to the device and the quality was not there at all.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>??Every Ipod I own is Great but my favorite is the ipod touch I bought an 8 gigabyte one and pluged it in and in a few minutes it had loaded my music and I was able to download applications that were free or cost a few dollars and they all did cool things.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>??I also had some ipod videos and they loaded quickly and played great.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>??The new ipod touch has built in speakers which work great but the availability of Ipod docks is great and some are not too expensive and some are expensive but they make the ipod sound like an incredible stereo system.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>??The ipod is light and is easy to find and change songs with the touch of a finger while other MP3 players are hard to put music on and you can not change to the song of your choice very easily.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The Ipod touch is by far the best Ipod I have ever owned, but if you do not have the money for it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Apple seems to have one that fits every budget they are no more expensive than those third party ones that only synchronize with a PC.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>so I say Buy the best it will last a long time and they have great technical support as well and a great warranty that can be added called Apple Care where if the battery goes bad they would even fix that under that protection plan.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>??I have had Ipod touch from the first generation to the most recent release and all have been great.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>??The price is a good value for the money you spend so if you like music go with the ipod it is the greatest.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>??There are also many accessories available for purchase like cases car chargers or even FM transmitters that let you play them in the car so what are you waiting for buy one today they are feature loaded and easy to use and come from one of the most reputable companies out there.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>??They also accept music from other sources other than Itunes so your music Library can be imported into Itunes and you do not have to re buy your music you already have</sentcont></sentence>

<reviewtitle>good, but don't go for it if you have the older version</reviewtitle>
<rating>0.8</rating>
<freereview><sentence><sentcont>Before i start let me just tell you "what's New" with the iPod touch Third generation" : -Faster Cpu/Double the ram/Better graphic (faster Boot time/faster loading is all what i did notice) -Double the storage for the same old price -Voice control (I'll explain it in a second) -Latest firmware for free -New Earbuds with built in remote+Microphone (So you can use voice control) And that is everything~ depends on your needs upgrading from 2G to 3G might be not worth it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>*Important Note* : only the New iPod touch 32GB/64GB are third generation ~ (8GB is repacked 2G) Details below.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>About the new Voice control function, if you love to take your iPod with you to the Gym the new feature "Voice control" is pretty cool.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>it does allow you to control your music via your voice, no need to get the iPod out of your pocket you can simply say "Next" to move to next song, say "shuffle" for shuffle , say "Pause" and music playback will stop etc.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>that is why i recommend the iPod touch over iPod classic for gym users, my friend bought an iPod classic and now he complains that the iPod classic is too heavy for him when he goes to the gym and he will have to buy another iPod "properly Nano" for his Gym.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>for me i use my iPod touch for the gym, it's so light that sometimes i forgot that it's even in my pocket.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>After playing with my iPod touch 3g for a while i honestly did not notice any difference from the outside or the inside compared to my old iPod touch Second generation.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>(It's supposed to be faster but i did not notice anything during music and video playback or the menus.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>however browsing with safari and loading facebook was faster, same thing with boot time), you properly can only notice it being faster with heavy applications since video/music playback is already fast enough with 2G.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I got the 64GB iPod 3G for [.</sentcont></sentence>

<sentence><sentcont>also remember that the 3G battery lasts less than 2G,(3G battery = 30 Hours of music playback versus 2G 36 hours of music playback according to apple official specs) *VERY IMPORTANT* for the people who wants the new 8GB version.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>the new third generation 8GB iPod touch is NOT 3G it's a second generation iPod touch but apple did repack it/renamed it to 3rd generation, which seems to be misleading by APPLE and it's not cool at all, it is IPod Touch 2G+Updated firmware and that is it.</sentcont></sentence>

<sentence><sentcont>Here is APPLE description on the iPod touches page about the 32/64GB versions : """Enjoy all the great features of the 8GB model along with better performance, richer graphics and voice control""" The iPod touch 3rd generation is the same awesome iPod touch second generation was.</sentcont></sentence>

<sentence><sentcont>Cons: -Not much of an upgrade over 2G (people were disappointed because they did not get upgrades like camera/OLED/etc).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>-Weaker battery, only lasts 30 hours for music playback versus 2G iPod touch 36 Hours music playback -Expensive for the 64GB version.</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>The iPod Touch debuted only one year ago, and this is the first update.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I was excited to pick up the new iPod Touch at the Apple Store because I had never owned a first generation, though I do own iPhones.??I want to concentrate primarily on the new features:??First, physical volume buttons are now placed on the side of the iPod Touch as they are on the iPhone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This is very convenient.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It allows you to adjust the volume of your music, without having to pull the entire device out of your pocket and activate the screen.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>A time saver.??Second, many people requested a built-in speaker for the iPod Touch like is available on the iPhone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Apple listened.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>However, there is one important point to make on this!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The iPod Touch is incredibly small, and Apple is forced to put an incredibly small speaker.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The speaker in the iPod Touch sounds worst than the speaker in the iPhone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I have compared it side by side, and it's fairly significant, and the iPhone speaker isn't that great to begin with.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>However, in a quiet room, the speaker is still useful for previewing a song you might want to buy, or for playing games.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>However, still, if you want great sound, you need to connect your headphones.??Genius - This new feature is really surprisingly good.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>When you're listening to a song you enjoy, select the genius option.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It will create a playlist for you, with songs that go together nicely with the one you started with.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It helps you rediscover great music from your collection with a playlist suited to the mood you're in.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I didn't think it would do a good job compiling this list, but it has been quite impressive.??Applications - It's great to have the ability to buy (or get some free) applications right on the iPod Touch.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Furthermore, with the software update this new iPod Touch comes with, the Application installation process is so much smoother than it had been even on my iPhone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It now works how you want it to, seamlessly.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I like having a weather application that includes doppler radar images, and that is free.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I also have several games on it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>There is a great variety of applications available from hundreds of third-parties right on the iPod itself, so you are certain to find something that interests you.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I really like the new release of Spore, for the iPod Touch and iPhone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Apple is really pushing the games and quietly suggest they are challenging Nintendo and Sony.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>They are innovative and interesting games, but I think they have a ways to go, to challenge those game makers.??Nike + is now built in too, so if you have the shoes and the puck, the iPod Touch is ready to receive the data from it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Battery life is improved to 36 hours audio and 6 hours video according to Apple.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I find the audio number fairly accurate if you don't light up the display much, but the video number is a slight bit harder to achieve.??Of course, the new ipod Touch does look and feel even better than the first generation, from my small experiences with the previous one.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I also think it feels cooler than my iPhones, but obviously your interpretation may very.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I like the metal back on the iPod Touch.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It looks classy, though it is prone to scratches.??One of my favorite features continues to be, when in my home on Wi-Fi, to reach down for the Touch, use Safari web browser and look something up.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's great.??Overall, it was a solid update for the iPod Touch.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I wish the speaker could be better on it, but I believe that is due to the physical restrictions of the small device.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I could have knocked it to four stars for that, but I think most people realize a built in speaker isn't the way you want to listen to most audio on an iPod to begin with.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I'm impressed by the second generation iPod Touch, and I think with the third party applications getting better and becoming more popular, more people will consider the Touch.</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>The good: The second-generation Apple iPod Touch has it all: music, videos, photos, podcasts, e-mail, Web browsing, Internet radio, games, Nike+, Wi-Fi music downloads, and an App Store for adding thousands of custom features.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The bad: The second-generation iPod Touch may be overwhelming to users looking for a simple music player; audio quality is average; and iTunes software is required.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The bottom line: The second-generation iPod Touch includes features that are light-years ahead of the competition, its design has improved, and its price has finally come down to earth.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Specifications: Device type: Digital player ; Flash memory installed: 32 GB; Digital player supported digital audio standards: AAC , MP3 , WAV , AIFF , Audible , Apple Lossless Design Apple's updates to the iPod Touch's design are subtle, but the hardware has definitely changed for the better.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>A slim volume switch now graces the left edge of the Touch, making it easier to make quick volume adjustments.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The chromed steel back of the second-generation iPod Touch now mimics the rounded design of the iPhone 3G, giving the device a slimmer profile at its edges.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Whether psychological or by design, the second-generation iPod Touch feels less fragile than last year's model and makes the plastic enclosure of the iPhone 3G feel cheap by comparison.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Minor improvements aside, the second-generation iPod Touch hardware is largely unchanged.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Both the first- and second-generation iPod Touch share the same dimensions (4.3 inches by 2.4 inches by 0.31 inch), same glass-covered screen (3.5 inch), and same arrangement of headphone jack, dock connector, sleep button, and home button.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Features Priced at $229 (8GB), $299 (16GB), and $399 (32GB), the second-generation iPod Touch still commands a fairly high price compared with other MP3 players with similar capacities.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>When you weigh the price of the iPod Touch against its features, however, the device becomes much more attractive.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Out of the box, the second-generation iPod Touch includes an amazing music player, podcast support, video playback (including iTunes rentals and a YouTube player).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>a Safari Web browser, photo viewer, an e-mail reader (compatible with Outlook, Exchange, MobileMe, Gmail, Yahoo, AOL, or any POP e-mail service), an integrated Wi-Fi iTunes music store, and a host of smaller utilities (weather, calendar, maps, stocks, notes, voice memos, clock, contacts, and calculator).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Provided you can become proficient with its touch-screen keyboard, the iPod Touch is more pocket PC than MP3 player.</sentcont></sentence>

<sentence><sentcont>(MobileMe subscribers can sync bookmarks wirelessly.) And iTunes backs up your iPod Touch every time you connect it, so if you lose your iPod Touch, you can replace it and restore all your apps and data, just like an iPhone.</sentcont></sentence>

<sentence><sentcont>The original iPod Touch had some excess noise in its amplifiers, noticeable during very quiet passages, but Apple seems to have fixed this.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>We couldn't detect any in the new model.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The iPod Touch's improved audio circuitry is masked by mediocre earbuds, however, as with the 3rd generation iPod Shuffle.</sentcont></sentence>

<sentcont> See Below, It would not fit </sentcont>
</sentence></con>
<freereview><sentence><sentcont>Pros:-Bright, colorful screen which is easy for me to see even in direct sunlight-Wide selection of applications available to expand on the functionality of my device, and there is a big developer community for the iPod touch and iPhone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Big name companied like PopCap Games, EA and Namco are developing.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>There is an unprecedented level of innovation and just plain neat and useful applications being developed by independent devs.-Connectivity options including WiFi and in 3.0 will be Bluetooth-Powerful mobile PIM device-Great media player-Device has great design and looks very stylish-Simplest PDA/smartphone operating system ever-Seemingly strong screen and body-Many fun casual and hardcore games are available for the deviceCons:-Mine has developed several deep scratches on the screen, but I have dropped it at least 3 times.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It has also developed many, many scratches on the aluminum backing.-Battery</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>life can be poor-My headphone port can feel quite cheap and loose-Mine becomes very hot whilst charging-On screen-keyboard can be hard to use, and landscape mode is not available in all applications-App Store should be called the Crapp Store - very hard to find the apps which are actually useful, functional or fun because of all the "Flashlight", "Lightsaber", "Beer", and "Fart" apps.-Does not sync Notes (coming in 10.5.7 with iPhone 3.0), cannot edit iWork documents (this is a big one)- NO CUT AND PASTE! (WORK ON THIS, APPLE!)In december of 2008, I was frantically trying to decide which new PDA to get: an iPod touch, or an HP iPaq 111 classic.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>My old device was a Dell Axim x5, so I was familiar with the Windows Mobile Platform.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I was also trying to decide whether my next computer sould be a Wintel or a Mac.I really wanted my next product to tie in with my next computer, and I was buying the PDA first, so it was crunch time - I had to choose.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Windows Mobile promised me a platform with tons of developers where anyone can make and publish their own program.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It also promised compatibility with Windows Vista/7 and Office 2007/14. the iPod touch, on the other hand, promised unmatched ease of use, Compatibility with Mac and Windows, and a thriving closed dev community where every app would be conveniently located in one place - the App Store.I knew If I bought the Windows Mobile device, I would be locked in with Windows because WinMo devices do not sync with Macs.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>(Yes, I know about MissingSync.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I do not want to pay for the basic capability to sync.)I always loved how all Apple products seemed to tie in with one another - iLife with itself, iTunes and Apple TV, Mac and iPod, Time Capsule and Mac, I chose the iPod and the Mac, and I have to say - I couldn't be happier.I was always really frustrated with how sluggish and complicated Windows Mobile was, and while iPod touch does slow down sometimes, It is much, much faster and way easier to use.Unfortunately</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>mine has developed several deep scratches on the front screen, only visible in direct sunlight but still an annoyance.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I have bought several cases for it, including the Belkin folio, the LuxMo rubberized case, and hopefully soon the beautiful iSkin Touch vibes case.My iPod has turned out to be a great devide, sepite a few flaws.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>My iPod touch does everything I want it to do whenever I want - perfectly.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It seamlessly integrates with my shiny new Mac to provide a bump-free and easy experience for me.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It manages my contacts and calendar, Plays my music and movies, checks the weather, gives me directions, lets me browse my photos, enables me to work on the go by checking old e-mails and browsing the web where there is Wi-Fi, checking Wikipedia, googling, Tweeting, checking movie times, reading books, checking RSS feeds, looking up words in the dictionary, checking my current Wi-Fi speeds, studying my Japanese, helping me go to sleep, fakes calls to get me out of stuff, plays the 32 awesome casual and hardcore games I've bought, is a dice shaker, pulls me down videos from youtube, converts currencies, translates, checks my stocks and a million other things - It is my perfect all in one device.If only it were a phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Oh wait, iPhone!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Mabye one day...</sentcont></sentence>

<sentcont> Calendar is read only, Fixed in update </sentcont>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>I love electronic toys.??</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I do not love cellular telephones.??</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I don't like being THAT accessible.??</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I love music and I love having my music portable and accessible.The iPod Touch is generally the iPhone without the phone.??</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I realize that's a generalization and there are other features the iPhone has, that the Touch does not, but that's a quick and dirty description of the Touch.The feature I like most about the Touch is the WiFi connection and Safari browser.??</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If you're in WiFi range your Touch is web capable.??</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If you've read that email on the Touch doesn't exist or that calendar entries are "read only" and you're hesitant, think about this.??</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If you're connected using the Touch's WiFi connection, why not check and respond to email via the Safari browser???</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I regularly check my Yahoo and Gmail on the Touch and it works flawlessly.??</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Additionally, since the Safari browser in the Touch is the same as the one in the iPhone, sites are being created to fit the mobile format.??</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I'm able to bank via Bank of America's mobile banking site.??</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>There are many other iPhone/Touch web apps being created and are found at apple.com/webapps/Calendar issues???</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Once again, if you use an online calendar service such as Google, Yahoo, or Airset, they're all accessible via the Safari browser when connected via WiFi.??</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If you're using Scrybe that's a challenge.??</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Right now the Safari browser isn't equipped with the Flash plugin.??</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I've read that Apple is considering updating that as well as allowing full calendar functionality on the Touch with a future update.?? Let's hope its soon.The</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>music player/video player section is what you'd expect of an iPod.?? Sleek, high tech and fully capable.?? You'll love it.??</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If only WiFi were more readily available the iPod Touch would be a great alternative to many other portable email/web surfing devices.?? Afterall, why pay all those data fees to a wireless carrier when you can access what you really need via WiFi?</sentcont></sentence>
