<sentcont> All buttons are within easy reach, each of the manual modes remembers the settings that you used last in that mode - not just blanket settings across all manual modes</sentcont>
<sentcont>The body is light, large screen that is easy to see even in bright sunlight, included kit lens (18-55mm) provides crisp images & if you treat yourself to a 58mm macro filter/adaptor it can produce some stunning close up images</sentcont>
<sentcont> Focusing is fast and quiet - the 9 AF points work well and on the whole the auto mode works well</sentcont>
<sentcont>I rarely change to a manually selected AF focal point</sentcont>
<sentcont>In some situations I do use manual focus - but mainly for macro shots</sentcont>
<sentcont> Auto white balance detection seems to work well, again I rarely use the manual selection and this is only if I'm using off camera flash with colour correcting gels etc</sentcont>
<sentcont> The custom user menu is a very useful feature that I use a lot....all the options that I use the most in one place - this can also be setup from your computer using the provided Canon software which makes it incredibly easy to setup</sentcont>
<sentcont> Battery life is excellent - even using the flash</sentcont>
<sentcont>I use the camera most days & can take around 250 shots over a few days before needing to think about charging again...I expect it would last a lot longer past this point</sentcont>
<sentcont> I have also used the camera with a Tamron AF 70-300mm LD Di Tele-Macro lens this is capable of some great photos, but the lens is not as crisp as the kit 18-55mm lens</sentcont>
<sentcont>Despite saying that it is a nice lens and works very well with the camera - its as great lens for everyday shooting, particularly for nature etc  If you properly compare the specs on this camera with others in the same price bracket, or even some of the other current Canon models (eg 40d), this camera provides serious power for the money & I would whole heartedly recommend it to anyone looking at getting a DSLR</sentcont>
</sentence></pro>
<con><sentence>
<sentcont> Bad may be a little strong   but here are a couple of fussy comments: The depth of field button is tricky to find....I find myself fumbling around trying to find it   I don't use it often so not too much of an issue</sentcont>
<sentcont>No proper auto focus in Live view mode   again not an option I use much anyway, but it would be nice</sentcont>
<sentcont>It would be nice to have some manual control over the built in flash   this is more a wish that a negative</sentcont>
<sentcont>I would also like to see a custom user program mode like some of the higher models have...that would be a very nice addition</sentcont>
<sentcont>I would also like to see a couple more ISO settings   what is provided is fine, I'm just greedy</sentcont>
<sentcont> My biggest negative comment is on the flash synch speed   the built in flash will only synch at 200, and the camera will not let you go faster than this</sentcont>
<sentcont>I also have an external flash setup with remote triggers and two different flash units that I use in manual mode   one of these synchs at 250 & the other at 160</sentcont>
<sentcont>It would be nice if Canon could half this or more and get the synch speed to 500 or faster     as far as I am aware this is the same for all current Canon models (although I may be wrong)</sentcont>
<sentcont> One point on software compatibilities   I shoot in RAW and use Adobe Lightroom to manage/adjust my photos</sentcont>
<sentcont>It seems that the set picture style is not taken into consideration by Lightroom, so your colours/contrast can appear off at first</sentcont>
<sentcont>There is now  set of beta released profiles for Lightroom 2 that does a good job of addressing this, but even still the colours are not quite the same as they appear in Canon's own software</sentcont>
<sentcont>If you shoot in jpeg, this is not an issue</sentcont>
