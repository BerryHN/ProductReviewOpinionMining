<reviewtitle>I absolutely love the Samsung NC10!</reviewtitle>
<rating>1.0</rating>
<freereview><sentence><sentcont>This netbook was exactly what i was looking for: compact, inexpensive, good quality, trusted name-brand, asthetically pleasing, the list goes on and on.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I looked and looked for netbooks on many websites such as Walmart.com, Amazon, and Bestbuy.com.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I did research on the netbooks at the time, and this was one that kept coming up with the top reviews.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I absolutely love it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>There isn't much that I can find wrong with it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The screen size is a little small if youre not used to it, but thats the way all netbooks are.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>A feature i love about this model is the font increase mode: you spread your fingers farther apart on the mouse-pad and the font becomes larger; pull your fingers closer together and the font becomes smaller.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Its very nice.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It has plenty of memory, a nice built in camera, and a nice keyboard.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The battery lasts a long time, and for the price you pay, you are really getting a deal for this one.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It is well worth it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Another thing that made me choose this netbook specifically was that it still had Windows XP.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I haven't heard very many good reviews on the new Windows running system, and I specifically wanted XP.</sentcont></sentence>

<pro><sentence>
<sentcont> Very light and compact with normal-size keyboard keys (most keys are in the expected position but the left shift button is absent which can be problematic)</sentcont>
<sentcont>Sleek and stylish look - this has one of the best, if not the best appearance in comparison to other netbooks on the market</sentcont>
<sentcont>The thin metallic strips that runs around the circumference of the netbook is really a great touch</sentcont>
<sentcont>Good battery life - I have used this for 3-5 hours intensively before without charging</sentcont>
<sentcont>Without intensive use I imagine the battery could sustain itself for up to 8 hours as the manufacturer indicates (so no lies on their behalf)</sentcont>
</sentence></pro>
<con><sentence>
<sentcont> The Intel Atom is not a strong processor in comparison to normal laptops</sentcont>
<sentcont>To get an idea you could probably run Internet Explorer/Mozilla Firefox with 6 or 7 tabs/windows open and loading up to which point the processor would struggle to let you run any other serious application like an office application or mp3 player</sentcont>
<sentcont>However if you're buying a netbook then this is to be expected I guess</sentcont>
<sentcont>  Another major negative is some of the keyboard glitches and the finger pad design</sentcont>
<sentcont>There are a couple of keyboard glitches for instance if you hold Shift or Ctrl and touch the mouse pad it will zoom in/out as there is an in built mouse scroller (a stupid idea)</sentcont>
<sentcont>This can be frustrating when typing an email for instance as the zooming in/out actually requires quite a bit of memory and can take a while to correct</sentcont>
<sentcont>However there may be a way to disable this annoying feature I haven't yet checked</sentcont>
<sentcont>This problem is enhanced by having such a sensitive finger pad</sentcont>
<sentcont>The finger pad is also quite poorly sized, my main concern is that it is too short</sentcont>
<sentcont>The width of the pad is fine but most people who have used a normal laptop will struggle to adjust to the new shape (widescreen shape)</sentcont>
<sentcont> Overall I have been satisified with the Samsung NC 10 and have not encountered any major faults or design errors</sentcont>
<sentcont>I would recommend this netbook to someone who is looking for a stylish, highly portable computer and only wants to surf the net or use very basic applications (i.e</sentcont>
<sentcont>Microsoft Office)</sentcont>

<sentcont> The Samsung NC10 has plenty of good points, the most imporant of which are: its compact size, a very bright evenly lit screen, a nicely weighted keyboard with near full size keys, battery life of about 6 hours on near full screen brightness (maximum brightness is VERY bright), a good but not overly sensitive track pad with scrolling, 1 gigabyte of RAM - enough for Windows XP which is the supplied operating system and a 160 gigabyte SATA hard drive</sentcont>
<sentcont> There are 3 USB sockets, microphone and headphone sockets, a VGA socket and a Lan socket and a SD card slot - so plenty of connectivity</sentcont>
<sentcont>Wi Fi connectivity is very good</sentcont>
<sentcont>It feels solid and well put together (mostly - see below) and is fairly quiet running</sentcont>
<sentcont>I am pleased with it</sentcont>
</sentence></pro>
<con><sentence>
<sentcont> No real bad points but a few issues   the case on mine can creak a little even though the build quality is good overall</sentcont>
<sentcont>1 gig of RAM is not enough for Vista or Windows 7 which I have now installed so I have upgraded to 2 gig   a very easy task</sentcont>
<sentcont>The sound could be better   it is very low in output but I find this acceptable for such good portability and very high degree of usability</sentcont>

</sentence></pro>
<con><sentence>
<sentcont> The mouse/track pad can be a bit tricky/too sensitive as sometimes when navigating the the screen/image can be zoomed without untending to</sentcont>
<sentcont> Software should have come with MS Office at least with trial version if not the full version as it cannot be easily installed without having to use an external DVD/CD drive and downloading MS office is not an ideal option as only MS office 2010 is available online when given its operating system is Windows XP, it is better suited to MS office 2003</sentcont>
<sentcont>  Could have done better with internal mobile broadband SIM option and would have prefferred by having an extra USB port, totalling to 4 USB</sentcont>
<sentcont> Also the display, thought good, it could have done better with a much higher resolution as some programme and website requires this (though Samsung has explained of getting around this on its website)</sentcont>
<sentcont>  When starting netbook for the 1st time, it gives the option of partitioning the hard drive, but the option of determining the size of the drive can be easily be missed as it happened in my case, hence partitioning 50% of the entire drive which would sendomnly be used accept for recovery</sentcont>
<sentcont>This can distort the normal perception of having 160 GB hard drive</sentcont>

<sentcont> Battery life excellent - will run for over 7 hours on full charge with light use, eg</sentcont>
<sentcont>surfing or word-processing</sentcont>
<sentcont>Screen is clear, evenly lit, bright and glare resistant</sentcont>
<sentcont>Sound through headphones is excellent</sentcont>
<sentcont>Keyboard is almost full size, and very nice to type on</sentcont>
<sentcont>My typing on this keyboard is actually slightly faster and more accurate than on a full-sized keyboard</sentcont>
<sentcont>Keys are sensibly positioned eg</sentcont>
<sentcont>'CTRL' is bottom left, 'Enter' key is good size and right-shift is easily found; much better than the keyboards on any other netbooks I looked at</sentcont>
<sentcont>Can be left on standby by closing lid and returned to the following day with no apparent loss of battery life - an excellent machine</sentcont>
<sentcont>SD / SD HC card slot useful for data backups</sentcont>
<sentcont>Wireless connection quick to connect from boot-up and has good range</sentcont>
<sentcont>There are numerous reviews of the NC10 on the web, mostly very positive; I haven't been disappointed</sentcont>
</sentence></pro>
<con><sentence>
<sentcont> Balance is slightly off   tends to tip backwards unless you support it correctly to compensate</sentcont>
<sentcont>Having used for a couple of weeks now though I soon adjusted to this and no longer find it a problem</sentcont>
<sentcont>Speakers are a bit weedy, but good enough for general use</sentcont>
<sentcont>If I want to listen to music then I generally use headphones anyway</sentcont>
<sentcont>No CD / DVD drive, but if you have another PC on your wireless network you can share the drives on that machine with the NC10 for data and applications</sentcont>

<sentcont> When I was researching the Netbooks on the market, I found they tended to fall into two groups;   1)Nice keyboard</sentcont>
<sentcont>Shame about the screen</sentcont>
<sentcont> 2) Nice screen, shame about the keyboard</sentcont>
<sentcont>  I eventually realised that if I was going to live with the device for any period of time, I had better fork out the little bit extra for the Samsung NC10</sentcont>
<sentcont> For the size of netbook, the keyboard is superb</sentcont>
<sentcont>Unlike many of it's rivals, the NC10's 'RETURN' key is an inversed "L"</sentcont>
<sentcont>This makes typing much easier</sentcont>
<sentcont>It was one of the main reasons for buying this unit</sentcont>
<sentcont> The screen is also excellent</sentcont>
<sentcont>The brightness is lovely & punchy</sentcont>
<sentcont>The screen surface is slightly matt to reduce reflection</sentcont>
<sentcont>If you like your battery life long, let the supplied power-save programme controll the screen</sentcont>
<sentcont>It will run at full brightness when on mains power</sentcont>
<sentcont>But when on battery, it will dim the screen slightly and then dim it further after a period of non use</sentcont>
<sentcont>As a result, the already high powered battery gives excellent performance</sentcont>
<sentcont> The lid on the blue model has a lovely gloss finnish</sentcont>
<sentcont>Considdering it has a traditional hard drive, the NC10 is surprisingly quiet</sentcont>
<sentcont>The ram can be upgraded via a small access panel and the power pack is a nice size too</sentcont>
<sentcont> I have used it for about an hour every day and I can safely say I made the right decision</sentcont>
</sentence></pro>
<con><sentence>
<sentcont> The battery (although a nice shape) adds weight</sentcont>
<sentcont>But you cannot change the laws of physics</sentcont>
<sentcont>A better battery is a heavier battery</sentcont>
<sentcont>My previous laptop was a desk top emulating beast</sentcont>
<sentcont>So the NC10 does not really offend</sentcont>
<sentcont> Samsung have used a relatively proprietry power socket</sentcont>
<sentcont>This limits your choice of car chargers ect..</sentcont>
<sentcont>At least on the high street anyway</sentcont>
<sentcont> It's lovely that Samsung has supplied a free case, but a little bit of padding, on the bottom at least would have made it perfect</sentcont>

<sentcont> An impressive amount of memory, and both keyboard and screen are great quality</sentcont>
<sentcont>I wouldn't believe the battery time though; presumably you can get that time if you don't so much as breathe on the laptop, but the moment you want to actually want to use it, it eats power</sentcont>
<sentcont>If you're also hoping to run a usb DVD drive off it, you might get the length of a movie out of it</sentcont>
<sentcont>Still the best on the market though - it just bothers me that they feel the need to exaggerate</sentcont>
<sentcont>To date, it seems the best netbook out there by far, though like all its peers, it seems to suffer from rather cheap plastic interior bezels once you've opened that wonderful shiny lid</sentcont>
<sentcont>Aside from that, build quality seem great to date; to give a comparison, I've previously had the ultra-compact Vaio and a neat little Compaq tablet</sentcont>
<sentcont>This one stands head and shoulders above its present competitors</sentcont>
</sentence></pro>
<con><sentence>
<sentcont> No bundled software at all, which considering the price is unforgivable</sentcont>
<sentcont>Having had a white keyboard before, I also wouldn't recommend one, unless you like having that attractive ground in dirt line to the edges of all your nice white keys which you have t get out cotton wool buds and alcohol to clean (yes I do wash my hands   you still get it!)</sentcont>
<sentcont>Also if, like me, you take and use your laptop everywhere, you'll soon find that you blind yourself on a sunny day if you look at the white keyboard a lot when you type</sentcont>
<sentcont>I chose the blue, which I haven't regretted yet, though as I said, the bezels once you open it up ar a little cheap and tacky, but then that's a common feature of the new batch of netbooks for some reason</sentcont>
<sentcont>All in all, there's nowhere near enough bad points on this little beauty to let 'em dissuade you from buying it</sentcont>

<sentcont> Battery is good, I run a program which is heavy on the battery use and the NC10 still gives me 4.5 to 5 hrs life, if I was just browsing or similar you can add a couple of hours to the battery life </sentcont>
