<freereview><sentence><sentcont>i've had the nokia n95 for about 2 months now and i've had no problems at all.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>the many features of this phone have come in very handy and i have the most powerful fone in my household.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>the only thng that are wrong wth this phone is the battery life and the lack of RAM! it comes standard with 64mb worth of ram which is quite scarce for a phone with this many features bt as soon as you boot up yhe phone, ur only left with 20mb! now that's just ridiculous!.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>putting together a fone with just 64mb ram is just pointless and vurtually makes simple applications or even multitasking impossible!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>if you try and browse something over the net, and the web page is full of complex media, which most web pages do have nowerdays, then it most certainly will close!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>RAM is the only thing that is affecting this fone otherwise it would've been perfect, i've heard that incrasing ram would drain the battery power to the max but there's a simple answer 2 that - supply the nokia n95 with a better phone!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>i hope this is the last time nokia puts this low amount of ram into their high end phones because the way fone technology is advancing now, 64mb of ram will not be enough to suit our demands from our fones!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>so this isn't what computers have become but they aren't far off, keep on going nokia!</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>First of all i would have to say this phone has the best speakerphone i have ever had on a cell phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Very crisp, and can be turned up extremely loud.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I've had it for almost a year now, and I haven't had any problems with it. it works great, you can use one hand to operate it and it's??jus that??easy.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It has everything you would want in a cellphone well i believe.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Batterylife, well, I only make calls when needed or if it's really important.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>because it consumes your battery more than if you will send text messages.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Instead.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I highly recommend it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It offers a lot of options.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>However I would have to say on the other hand the call quality of using the handset is??above average to me.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Even when the volume is turned all the way up, it is sometimes??easy to hear who you are talking to on the other end, and that can be annoying lol depending on who it is.. (:-) .</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Sometimes I am forced to turn the speakerphone on when I would prefer to use the handset when in the car??without blue tooth.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The downloadable applications are very impressive, alot of options as far as those are concerned.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The camera takes great pics.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The battery does get used up fast when you are using the applications.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>One other thing is that the lcd screen will scratch and show marks, so I would highly recommend some type of shield or screen protector.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Overall a solid phone, I would say above average in most aspects.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>let me tell you before buying this phone i did alot of research on a number of phones and i chose this one.I had a list of things I wanted in a phone and I have to say, this phone not only had everything I've ever needed, but I was surprised on things I didn't know about!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>For instance, I didn't even know it had an accelerometer when I bought it!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But for now I'll just list the major features and review them:  CAMERA(s): The main 5MP camera takes great pictures.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Obviously it's not the same quality as a stand alone, say Sony Cybershot of equal quality.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But the different scene shots and bright flash make up for that.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>(portrait, night shots, fast-moving, etc) Video is as good if not better than a Sony Cybershot point and shoot camera.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>(You can even edit pictures right on your phone!)CALL QUALITY/SPEAKERPHONE: Call quality has been very good.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Speakerphone is VERY loud thanks to the pair of high quality speakers.GPS:</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The assisted GPS antenna on the device is pretty good.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>When using Nokia Maps to navigate, it takes very little time to connect (5-10 secs mostly) You have to keep the slider open however to get good signal.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If you don't like nokia maps, you can always buy/download other software like Google maps, TomTom, etc. Very handy.BLUETOOTH:</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Basically like any other bluetooth.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It can connect to headsets, other devices, computers, and it also is compatible with A2DPEMAIL: It its own email client that you can set whatever address to or you could use the free Gmail app if you have gmail.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>(thats what I do)MUSIC PLAYER: 8GB memory.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>To today's standards, thats not a very big size for a primary music player.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>However, when you transfer music to the device from Nokia's PC Suite, it asks you if you want to convert the songs to a smaller format (~5 times smaller) which is very helpful in storing more songs.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Other than that, its a great player with many features.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>(Playlists, shuffle, album art, EQ, etc) Great speakers too.WiFi/3G:</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>WiFi connects very quickly and smoothly.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>3G signal is great too.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Every now and then it will cut out but will automatically continue.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Even reaches 3.5G speeds (HSDPA) on AT&T's network.CALENDAR:</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Nicely laid out with many viewing options.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Can add new memo's, tasks, meetings, and anniversaries.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Can also sync with computer.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>(Assuming outlook, but don't use)ACCELEROMETER: VERY cool to have.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Enables the phone to auto-rotate when phone is flipped sideways.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Also automatically straightens pictures that were taken sideways.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>And MANY more applications that you can download that use the accelerometer like games or cool apps like Step Counter.COMPUTER SOFTWARE: Didn't realize this was a big thing until I tried to sync a Blackberry to a computer one time.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Not very user friendly.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But Nokia's PC Suit is the most simple, yet powerful sync program I've ever seen.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Can easily use phone to connect your computer to the internet with the touch of a button.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Or you can read, sort, and reply to your text messages on your computer.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Very, very nicely designed.BATTERY</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>LIFE: As the N95 was my first smartphone I've ever had, I didn't realize this was as big of an issue.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But sadly on the N95, the battery life is terribly underrated for the many features this phone has.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I charge it every night and even when doing minimal things on the phone, it will usually die around 6pm.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Nokia knows this, which is why they offer different types of portable battery packs and ways to charge your phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Gets very irritating at times but just make sure you carry an extra battery or 7 around with you.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>:)  So overall, this phone has been everything you really need in a phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I get comments all the time on the lack of a touchscreen and full keypad.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Truth is, you really don't need either.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The predictive text function does the job good enough and touch screens don't do much for me.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This phone is focused around applications.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>There are hundreds and hundreds of applications (usually free) you can download that do anything from make your phone into a portable lightsaber to turning your phone into it's own WiFi Hotspot.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The options are limitless with apps."</sentcont></sentence>

<sentence><sentcont>nokia n95, apple iphone, htc shift, nokia e90 comunicator, sony ericsson w960, sony ericsson p1.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Compare good and bad in relation to the other candidates.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>nokia n95  good: gps, vibrant high-res screen, 5 MP camera, vga video recording, hsdpa,   bad: short battery life, ugly, vuneruble dubble slide design, big, not touch screen.</sentcont></sentence>

<sentence><sentcont>htc shift good: has everything bad: huge (a small laptop).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>nokia e90 comunicator good: has everything bad: big, borderline ugly.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>sony ericsson w960 good: 8GB memory, stereo bluetooth headset, looks nice, touch screen, walkman.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>bad: no memory slot, low resoulution on that big screen, no hsdpa.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>sony ericsson p1 good: qwerty keyboard, card slot bad: hard qwerty keyboard, low resoulution on that big screen, borderline ugly, no hsdpa.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>To summerize this the n95 is a super phone beacuse it packs all features exept touch screen in a compact format but it falls away beacuse of short batterytime and low build quality and that it is a bit on the big size (just little to big.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>), iPhone is joke its just a ipod video with a nice screen and webbrowser and a phone feature it lacks in all departments, htc shift is amazing it realy is a super tiny laptop with touchscreen but you cant have it in your pocket and that is not acceptble, e90 has everything including a keyboard and .</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>sdpa in a small package I defenitly have to look at it in the stores before I buy w960 im just afraid e90 will look ugly and big in real life, p1 and w960 is the same phone diffrence is that p1 has cardslot and qwerty keyboard and that w960 has 8GB memory with no cardslot and a regular phone look a.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>d a music and finger oriented interface and bundeled bluetooth headphones, the p1 is kund of geeky and ugly in real life and the keyboard is way to unnatural to use so if I have to choose between them it must be w960.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>To summerize the summerization it stands between the e90 and the w960,  e90 has advantages such as full qwert keyboard, hsdpa, gps, exelent screen, allmost full laptop replacement.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But w960 has som advantages such as allmost normal phone size and normal phone looks and touch screen and bundeled stereo bluetooth headset.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Price is bound to be lower for w960 to.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So i guess it comes down to these questions:  Is money not a problem?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Do you want a real buissniess phone?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Want gps, hsdpa, highres screen?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Is it ok with a big phone that fills your entire pocket and weighs a bit and looks like a small laptop and looks a bit nerdy?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Then I think e90 is the right choice!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Do you want a phone that looks like a phone?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Do you want lots of buisnesiss features and touchscreen that is navigated both with fingers or stylus?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Is UMTS ok speed for your mobile surfing needs nearest 1-2 years?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Can you live without GPS 1-2 years?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Do you want to pay as little as possible for this device with bundled stereo bluetooth headphones?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Will you mostly use your device as a mp3 player and phone?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Then maby the w960 is more correct.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>(Remember n95 have much of what e90 have but with short battery time it disqualify itself before the race.)    Hope someone had benefit from this text.</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>I work for the carphone warehouse, we launched it today, so don't wait around till the 9th of April for o2 direct when we are doing the same deals!!!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It is in high demand and is more likely to be in stores than on the website which has it as *out of stock*.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>A few things to note.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Don't know what that previous review was on about, the screen size and coloure is far supirior to that of the N80, and i owned the N80, which i couldn't get rid of quick enough, was the worst most expensive phone i have had, and in my opinion, and i tell my customers this, the N-series is awfull, slow and full of bugs!.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Nokia have been well aware of this with terrible sales and targets not met.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So we were worried about the N95, as with all the N-series, they look great on paper but in reality they have to much on them and not enough juice or proper software to cope with it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I am really happy to say that the N95 is by far the best phone nokia have produced, we got ours 5 days ago, but due to Nokia launch date we weren't aloud to sell them, so we've had a good play with them.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>First thing first,    *Be aware that the GPS is very smart, graphics are quick and easy and does not suffer from time delay as we thought it may, take note though that it is not a TOM TOM and your network provider will charge you for data connections using this service.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>How ever if u went for a company like t-mobile then the web and walk will more than pay for it's self, especially when using the integrated web browser!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Which by the way is very smart and was my favourite feature of the N80 (they have made it easier to use the WiFi on this, the N80 process was long and VERY tiersome to connect up!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>*Battery life in store seems SO much better than the N80, my N80 would need ot be charged most nights, especially is using WiFi or the cam, be aware though that you can half the battery life of what r.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>views tell you as they do not take in to acount what you are using are are calculated in a lab whihc does not take signal stregth in to acount, meaning that if you are in a weak signal area for your network your battery life will not be long.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>*Something to also take in to acount is the menu system, not sure wether this is just me, but i find the menu system really complicated and not intiative, and you will be spending the best part of a week rememebering where things are with in the menus.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>*the screen size is much larger than the N80, and it's lost some of it's weight as well, whihc is a bonus.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>We took some pictures on it's 5mp cam, and it was very good!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>how ever, where it will fail is at night time, as they still haven't built in a proper xeone flash... come on nokia!!!!! catch up with the cybershot technology on the Sony!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It is a shame!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>how ever in day time the pictures are great!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Do not be fooled by websites such as ebay sellers who claim it has DVD like video capature, this is not the case! it does VGA 30fps, that is not DVD like how ever it's like the N80 and is far supirior than any other phones video recorder.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Where the N95 really shines is in it's processor.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It is with out a doubt the most powerfull one i have seen on a phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>To demonstrate it jsut go in to a store and ask them to show you the games, you will be hard pushed to tell the difference between the graphics on the n95 and that of a playstation 1... maybe even 2! It really is that smart!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In conclusion, it is far supiror to it's predesossor, and Nokia have seemed to have ironed out the bug problems the N80 died of, it's quicker and more powerfull.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>How ever it's new and i only had 3 days with it, so time will tell, but i really hope it does well... it needs too, and as of yet it's biggest competitor Sony have not released anything with 5mp on it or anything as powerfull as this...which is also a shame.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's light, it's bright, it's powerfull, and it's a nice looking phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The dual slide worries me a a bit though as it can be a bit anoying when it keeps going in to different menus.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The short cut keys need more work on them, but it is very customisable so i shoudl imagine you can get round it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In all it is the best handset out at the moment, and should be at ?500!    p.s. you'll LOVE the music player! the sound is great out of the stereo speakers!</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>The other Nokia phones I owned before this amazing N95 are 3310, 6801, 6600, 6680, & N70 and older models which I can not even remember.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I??ve never tried using any other brand, except the blackberry which I am forced to use for work.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I had my eye on this N95 because I love taking pictures and this phone has a 5 mega pixel camera w/ auto focus Carl Zeiss lens.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>To my surprise, there was so much in stored for me!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This ultimately tops any gadget I ever owned.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It is also the most expensive phone I have, but I believe that it is well worth your money since it is used heavily on a daily basis.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If you add up the cost of a cell phone + 1G micro mini memory card + MP3 player + GPS + digital camera + camcorder + video player (btw-you could hook the phone to your tv and play your videos or a photo slideshow w/ music)+ radio+ fast browser + and so many pluses etc..</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>You would be well over $1,000 if you purchased each of those items individually.I know that most people complain that the phone is "plastic like" but I can tell you that I dropped my phone on a flight of marbled stairs and it surprisingly only got 2 scratches and nothing was cracked and it still works fine (thank God cause I was going to cry!)To show you how useful and amazingly productive this all-in-one phone is, allow me to describe how my day went during a recent trip to Santa Monica.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This is in addition to making calls and sending text messages.Before</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>getting out of bed in the morning, I connected to the internet via our wireless network and checked my email.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Then, I checked my calendar (which was sync to my desktop outlook) to look up the details of my flight.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>At the airport, while waiting for my flight I used the calculator to compute my expenses and the internet to check my email and even kill some time browsing and bidding on eBay.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I also secretly used the camera in the front to make sure that my hair was tidy and my teeth were clean (it??s like looking in a mirror, ha ha!).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Then I plugged in my earphones to listened to the radio.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Still at the airport, while waiting outside the bookstore, the phone was in my bag.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>My ringing tone goes off and since the ???Say Caller??s Name??? option was selected, I knew it was my husband calling me before I even looked at the phone to see who it was.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This function is so handy especially while you are driving.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>You can concentrate on the road without the distractions and hassles of finding your phone and reading your caller ID to see/know who is calling you.On the plane, I listened to some talk shows and music that I previously uploaded for my trip.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Btw- it is so easy to transfer these from your computer to your phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>You could also download these via rss feeds.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Upon arriving I took some photos and videos of the beach and our hotel using the 5megapixel camera.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>While chilling in the room I played some games that I downloaded from getjar.com.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Then I used the map to browse nearby restaurants and get the addresses and directions.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I also sent a text message to Google to get instant results for the nearest drugstore.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I did this by typing ???location, drugstore, Santa Monica??? and sending the message to 46645 which is Google SMS here in the US.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I instantly received several listings via text messaging.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Before going to bed, I set my alarm clock and checked my email and browsed for a bit and watched a few YouTube videos from the video centre.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I also watched some of the videos I took earlier at the beach.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Finally, I visited mobible.org to read the psalm of the day and then plug my earphones in to listen to the rest of my talk shows and quickly fell asleep.With this phone, I easily eliminate bringing the following items on this trip which is really the equivalent of additional luggage:- alarm clock- calendar- calculator- map- yellow pages- mirror- laptop- camera- camcorder- radio- mp3 player- gameboy/psp/DS- all the chargers/ plugs/ batteries that come with these gadgets- and yes that thick heavy book, the holy bible ??For those who are debating whether to get this all-in-one phone, I say YES it is well worth it only if you are planning on utilizing and maximizing all the functions.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If you do not need all the functions, this phone is NOT for you and you should not splurge just to have it because the technology may be too complicated for you.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Seriously.</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>Nokia's N95 superphone is complicated, taking days for even the most experienced gadget journo to digest.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>That's why lots of reviews I've seen so far are either extremely light or 10,000 word stunners: This is one of those long ones.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's likely easier to pore over the phone yourself in our hardware and software gallery walkthroughs, and come up with your own opinion.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But If you want the text heavy version, here's what's great and terrible about this phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Aside from call quality, why Nokia's N95 Rocks:1.GPS:</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The GPS is really GPS, not some assisted-GPS that Sprint and Verizon have in their phones.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>That means you can really navigate with it, like I did, to streets around SF I wasn't too familiar with.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>(Specifically, the corner of Washington and Cherry, close to where the Zodiac killer blew away a Cabbie so many years ago.)</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The point of interest database is sizable and you can search for things by proximity (the nearest ATM or liquor store), and then get the phone dialing right up.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Turn by turn is a subscription that'll cost you about $10 a month, and the voice nav won't read street names, but that, and the phone's persistant Lag aside, it rocks.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>2.Camera: I detect a decent level of grain in these 5mp shots, and the shutter lag is horrendous, but WTF, it's a 5mp camera with a Carl Zeiss 2.8/5.6 autofocusing lens in a phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>There are great controls for ISO, white balance, sharpness, contrast, and flash.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>And video comes in at 640 by 480 at 30fps.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Not shabby.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>And the editing programs are powerful, especially the photo editor's clip art feature.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Proof is in the pudding: Check out Flickr's N95 photos.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>3. Lifeblog: Like other N-series phones, this one can post any text/video/image you take with the phone to a blog.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I'm addicted to this.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This can be done through the Lifeblog software, which will combine text and images into a blog post on Typepad.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The phone will send pictures Flickr's API, too.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>(And via Flickr's blog API, can send photos to most other blog ware.) Right now, Vox is the only site that will accept automated upload videos.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But I'm willing to bet there's even a youtube uploader out there, considering the Symbian OS's dev community.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>4. Media Playback: The mp3/video player is fairly straight forward, and that's why I like it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The speakers are unreasonably loud, in a good way, for a device of this side - as loud as the Samsung K5 with external speakers - and there's an EQ as well as visualizations.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>File support includes MP3/WMA/M4A, and AAC support for those soon to be unlocked iTunes/EMI files.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The media playback buttons aren't the easiest to press, but they add to the simplicity and dedication this device has to AV. Add in support for Podcasts, even those of the video variety, and you're talking.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>(MPEG-4, H.264/AVC, H.263/3GPP, RealVideo 8/9/10) 5. Extras: I admit this is cheating on a list of 5, but all the little included apps really help bring the Nokia up.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>There are office document readers/editors, a standard convertor, calculator, zip utilities, GPS utilities, VOIP (Gizmo Project), a uPNP media server, and all your basic txt/sms/email/browsing/bluetooth, on and on and on.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Feature-wise, it is what a phone could be, given today's technology, minus phone carrier greed.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>(All in our feature walkthrough.)</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Why Nokia's N95 Sucks:1.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Battery: No matter what anyone says, the battery life on the N95 isn't good.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>You can justify it by considering how much power true GPS, WiFi, and those booming speakers take.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Even turning off 3G access, as you won't find reception in the US, the phone will be begging for DC after an 18 hour day of moderate/heavy use.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>2. HSDPA Europe only: This phone is a European variant, and its WCDMA 2100 radio can't tap Cingular's US band HSDPA.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So, you're stuck with EDGE speeds when you're not close to WiFi.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Here's a tip: Turn off the 3G support to save some battery life.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>And get used to using WiFi for the heavy Audio/Video Tranfers.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>3. Laggy OS: I don't know whether to blame Symbian or Nokia, but I don't really care, who's fault it is: This phone is sluggish.5.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Hardware Feels Junky:Two words: Fisher Price.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>They should have packed these components into a denser package.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The world's most powerful handset is also the thickest modern phone without a QWERTY.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But consider all it does, and the fact that its still pocketable, and you can over look its rather portly 0.8 inch thickness.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Full hardware rundown here.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>5. Price: $750 dollars is an unsubsidized price, and I commend Nokia for bringing this unlocked beast of a phone to the US without carriers who'll lock up both the SIM slot and the multimedia features.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But that's a lot of money.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I'd find that more acceptable if the GPS didn't require a subscription, the office software edited without buying an upgrade, and if the rest of my complaints were firmly answered.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>You have to use this phone for yourself (or go on through the walkthroughs below) before you spend this much cash on a portable computer/phone/thingy.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Even then, only the die hardest phone geeks and those who can benefit from the phone's liveblogging capabilities should consider it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>??</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>Hi guys.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I would like to give some different look on the comments of this phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I am still thinking whether go for this phone or not.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Besides I have some bad experience with N80 last year.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I played with a N95 of a friend of mine, but just for 2 days so I cannot make some solid conclusion based on such short experience.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So I am very cautious.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Let us try to make some objective and reasonable judgments in order to get a more comprehensive picture of the, let call it this way, "the real N95":).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Having read a lot of opinions here (I am following them from the beginning of the year) I would try to draw some of the main groups of problems giving some general or specific comments on cons.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Also to point out not only the weak points but also the strong and "innovative" features.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>(Because it can obviously be seen that the majority of posts here are totally opposite - one are saying "this is the best phone I have ever had", while the other are saying - "this is the worst phone, dont buy it".</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So let?s group the points of interest like this.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>1.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Battery life; 2.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The 5 MP camera; 3.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Video; 4.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The phone hangs; 5.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Problems during a call; 6.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>GPS; 7.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Music; 8.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Display; 9.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Robustness of the design.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>1.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Battery life.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The disappointing battery life was expected.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In the posts from January-February a very few guys were reporting the phone should be charged daily or even twice a day; because only few had the chance to use the pilot release and because the rest were dazzled by the specs of the phone and eager to get some kind "Lord of the phones" (there were such expression in a post here).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Nevertheless, having the experience with N80, everyday charge is something very boring.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Especially after elapsing the first one-two months when the delight of using such a complicated device is gone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The second battery partially solves the problem but still you have to pay to much care for that - always to have the spare battery charged, to replace batteries when the one in the phone is drained.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The other approach is to restrain from playing with the wifi browsing, or shooting videos if you are on the move during the day and cannot plug in the charger.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In a moment you start asking yourself - does the phone serve you or you serve the phone?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Or there are some ?tricks? to prolong the batt life - disable 3G, or reduce wifi sensitivity, or not to shoot to much, or not to listen to the music too much, or not use the GPS, etc - well, why should you buy such device if you do not use its features?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Someone here were giving the example with Ferrari - they say the Ferrari consumes too much fuel but still it is a Ferrari - ok the comparison is not that correct.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Fuel consumption is not the analogue of the power (battery) consumption though both are related to energy; here the issue is the USABILITY OF PERFORMANCE ?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>a ?fuel</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>hungry" Ferrari is giving its full performance to the user, but a ?power/battery</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>hungry?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>phone cannot deliver its potential to the user because it simply cannot last enough to give the overall performance to be consumed (?overall?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>means all features, not use only gps, or use only camera, or only make voice calls).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If you have a Ferrari, would you close it in the garage and drive it rarely ?on last Sunday of the month?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>or would you enjoy it everyday as much as possible - if you are happy with the speed and acceleration, etc of a standard car, why should you go for a Ferrari?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Right?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>However let?s gulp down this problem and take it for granted that we cannot have normal battery last in a ?multimedia?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>N-phone (?normal? is something between 3-5 days; or at least firmly over 2 full days (48 hours), regardless of usage of the features, OK?).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Of course some will say - well you have all-in-one device, so how could you expect longer time?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>OK, to that statement I would oppose the above mentioned question - do the phone serves you or you serve the phone?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>And what is better, to have 10 separate devices that are giving their full performance, or one single device combining them but giving you just one feature at a time of all these 10?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Is it a kind of philosophical question?:)</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>no it is a technical question - the device should support all the features it is designed to.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Again with the car analogy ? the car should perform as a car despite of whether you dirve it in the summer (hot) or in the winter (cold), or whether you drive it in a sunny day (no light, heaters, fans, etc) or in a rainy evening (with all electrical stuff switched on), Right?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So, in the end, there is no excuse for the poor battery life.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>2. The 5 MP camera.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It is clear that a phone camera will never be at the level of the current dedicated cameras.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So wheter it is 5 MP or 3.2 MP, it is almost the same.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Further more, it is welknown that Nokia still cannot reach the quality of the SonyEricsson competitors in the mobilephone cameras.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So do not expect the unexpected in this area.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>No need to go deeper in the subject, everything is clear I think.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>3. Video  Here I think we should give the deserved for the phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The feature of VGA video shooting is very very nice.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Again to expect hte quality of dedicated videocamera is irrelevant.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But compared to the CIF and QVGA resolutions in previous phones, the VGA video in your phone is quite usefull and handy.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>4. The phone hangs  Well this should be precicsely specified when it hangs.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>We cannot expect this phone to behave like a computer, desipte that it is equipped with a 330 MHz processor.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>At the time of the 300 MHz Pentiums we had not have so rich multimedia content, right?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In my N80, I couldn't open a pdf or doc bigger then 800-900 KB.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Here we also have 64 MB RAM, of whic about 20-22 MB free (as far as I saw when played with a N95).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Here may be the ad "a multimedia computer" plyes a bad joke for the users - remember this is not a computer, so do not expect to perform like a PC (how often your PC hangs when running some big or complex stuff?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>for me, relatively often the Windows Media Player or Real Player hang when starting a movie).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But the bad thing is that the phone realy behaves slow when opening the images/videos.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>that is something that I definately observed in my short test with the phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>5. Problems during a call (Noise or fuzz or buzzz or whatever during a call)  That is a serious problem (if present).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I have not noticed it but saw several posts about it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So pls say how many of you have noticed it in your phones.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>6. GPS  The chipset in N95 is a Texas Instruments one, not a Sirf III or RFMD, or not even a Sirf II.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So do not expect to have the performance of them.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Here the real problem is in the time to wait for lockon the satellites.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Waiting over 3-4 minutes makes the GPS a thoughtless feature.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Lot of people complain they were waiting 10 or even 15 minutes for "satellite signal".</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>(Me personally could not start the gps at all ...).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The other "problem" here is that the phone could not use the built in GPS receiver with third party navigation programs.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>On the phone I played with, I used a Holluv Sirf III GPS and connected it via Bluetooth to N95 and it worked perfect with TomTOm6.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But why is the built in GPS chip than?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Concerning the maps of "over 100 countries or so" - the idea of having all the info accessible from a app like smart2go in the Nokia is very good.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But still it is not yet fully-usable worldwide (apparently).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But still it is a very good idea so let us be more patient and understanding.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So about the GPS we may want a lot of improvements, both in the phone firmware and hardware and in the info database from Nokia.    7. Music  Playing music is better than N80.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>About the sound quality - I expected much better from the "stereo" speakers.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But if you plug in good earphones (not these coming with the phone) it is absolutely ok.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Again do not expect this device to sound like your home stereo.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>8. Display  Notably worse than in N80 - we have larger screen with smaller resolution in N95.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It is obvious when look on the very nice data given in the gsmarena.com</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>review:   Nokia N95 	40 x 53 mm 	240 x 320 pixels 	3,623 pixels/cm 2  Nokia N80 	35 x 41 mm 	352 x 416 pixels 	10,204 pixels/cm 2    9. Robustness of the design  Some people, also in the reviews, it is reported of noises when sliding the slide, or when pressing the buttons on the slide.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This is something that was present in N80 too.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But in N80 also the battery door on the back was loose, something that in N95 is amended.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>WHen we have a slide, it just could not be as robust as the bar.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If you were not bored in reading all this, I would ask you to help in trying to expand the list of problem groups.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In this way we can justify reasonably and get a clear overall picture of "the real N95" and not just to say - this is the a "crown", or this is a "rubbish".</sentcont></sentence>

<sentcont> Best display, tons of great & useful apps, best camera </sentcont>
</sentence></pro>
<con><sentence>
<sentcont> GPS maps should've been pre-installed on the memory card </sentcont>
</sentence></con>
<freereview><sentence><sentcont>Purchased N95 last week.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Before I used a 8801, N93, N80, 6270, 6280, Razr V3, Sony Ericsson w850i, e.t.c....too many to list.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>For those of you who are still wondering weather or not it's a good phone for the $, if you have an extra $700 - this is the phone to get.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It has all the features that the phone can have, excellent camera, GPS, e.t.c.Let me start with the camera.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I can only say positive things about it, since it provides excellent pictures not only outside, as many of other users stated, but in the dark as well!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The color balance is great.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Although I would wish some optical zoom...</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I took some pictures in a totally dark environment without any light - came out great!! This can really substitute for a digital camera, if you don't care about optical zoom.GPS needs upgrading.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I didn't find any pre-loaded maps, and you need a wi-fi connection to download them.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Speaking of which, i found wifi to be a great upgrade over the N80's first edition.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>N80 always gave me 'out of memory' errors whenever browsing the web, as I'm a heavy i-net user, working as an IT. On the other hand, you can see Nokia fixed it with the N95.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Only once I got that same error message, while having multiple apps running on the background, which is understandable with MP3 player, Real player, Snakes 3D, and browsing the web.The phone comes with the 'downloads' link, where you can download some nice free apps as well, such as antivirus, games, ringtones.Bluetooth</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>works great, I would suggest one to download an upgraded version of Nokia PC Suite (6.83 I believe) because it fixes many known bugs.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Mp3 player is great too, it comes with visualizations, so your friends will go 'WoooooooW'!!!!The battery life is desent for this type of phone with that many features.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Nokia once again upgraded the battery to BL-5F.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's a litttle bigger, but provides a much longer talking time over the other N-series.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Using the phone all day, playing MP3's for an hour at the gym, with bluetooth turned on all day long, it finally needed charging at night.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Finally, the video camera also doesn't disappoint.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The videos are great, although not DVD-quality like Nokia suggests, they are the best I've ever seen on a cellular phone, much better than on the N93i.One more thing I wanted to mention -- the phone is very well balanced, and feels great in hand.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I love the slider, eventhough it's not an 'assisted one', it still feels much better than over the worst sliding mechanism - N80.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The buttom row of buttons (* 0 #) is very close to the edge, which can make it hard for text messaging.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The number pad, on the other hand, has a great feel to it, so you don't have to look at it all the time while dialing (I txt message a lot, so had to memorize all the letters)).So, for thouse of you, folks, that are still wondering what to do with your $700...</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I think N95 is definitely worth considering.</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>September 26, 2006.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Nokia Open Studio 2006, New York, US - Nokia today introduced the Nokia N95, an all-in-one multimedia computer with a pioneering 2-way slide concept, integrated GPS functionality, a 5 megapixel camera and support for high-speed mobile networks, making it easier to watch and record videos, listen to songs, take high-quality photos, browse the internet, or catch up on email while on the move.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>"The Nokia N95 brings a range of multimedia ingredients together, such as a fantastic display, outstanding photo and video capability and high-speed connectivity, making it the ultimate multimedia computer," said Anssi Vanjoki, Executive Vice President, Multimedia, Nokia.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>"This single device - which fits easily in your pocket - can replace stand-alone devices that you no longer need, whether it's your music player, your digital camera, PDA or navigation device.</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>September 26th     Nokia have announced the Nokia N95, featuring an innovative double slide design with multimedia controls and a keypad on opposite end of the phones.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Read on for full details, pictures and the full press release.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Summary: The N95 is Nokia's first HSDPA (3.5G) device, but also boasts Wi-Fi, WCDMA, quad-band GSM, Bluetooth (including A2DP), IrDA and USB 2.0 connectivity (via  mini USB connector).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Other hardware features include a 5 megapixel camera, a built in GPS, TV-Out, 3.5mm audio jack, FM Radio, a MicroSD memory card slot and 150MB of internal memory.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In the hand the most impressive aspect of the device, given its feature set, is its size.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>At 99mm x 20mm x 53mm (90cc), the N93 packs an impressively amount into a small space.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Nokia have managed to add two major technologies to the Nseries line (GPS and HSDPA) while significantly reducing the volume of the device.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In length and width dimensions it is larger that the other Nseries slider - the N80, but it is considerably thinner.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>HSPDA is the next generationin cellular connectivity.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The N95 is a category 6 HSPDA device which means it is up to 10 times faster that WCDMA (3G).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Clearly HSDPA support is required at a network level, but many networks have already begun their testing or roll out periods.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The faster connection speeds make downloading media (such as podcasts via the in built Podcast application) more palatable and should also improve latency/round trip times.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Wi-Fi, WCDMA (3G) connectivity, together with quad band GSM and EDGE are also supported.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Bluetooth 2.0, IrDA and USB make up the local connectivity options.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The 5.0 megapixel camera uses Carl Zeiss Optics with autofocus and digital zoom with a dedicated 2 stage capture button on the side of the phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Video capture at near DVD quality is also supported.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>On the side of the device there are several buttons dedicated to camera usage.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This allows the device to be held in a similar way to a traditional camera with the screen, in landscape mode, used as the view finder and the shutter button on bottom right hand side of the device (top right when phone is held horizontally).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>On the rear of the device, next to the camera is the slide switch, which is used to open the lens aperture and activate camera mode.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Although it is difficult to judge the image quality at this stage the evidence we saw suggest that the N95 will be on of the most capable camera phones available.</sentcont></sentence>

<sentence><sentcont>Although it is difficult to judge the image quality at this stage the evidence we saw suggest that the N95 will be on of the most capable camera phones available.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>A GPS is integrated into the device with anticipated accuracy of around 10m (satellite signal permitting).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The devices will ship with an application called Maps which has global overview maps built in.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>More detailed maps (with coverage over more than 100 different countries available) can be downloaded for free from an online server.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The detail available varies from country to country, but in many cases it is available down to street level.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>A point of interest (POI) database is also included.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>All the maps are available for free, as is basic route planning, but navigation functionality (with voice and on screen prompts) will be available as a pay-for add on.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>City Guides will also be available for purchase and other services are likely to be made available in the future.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The mapping software and services is likely to based on technology from gate5, a company which Nokia recently announced it was acquiring.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Music playback is also a major focus of the device.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The dedicated multimedia keys on the top flip of the device are primarily designed for music playback (although can also be used in other multimedia contexts).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Wireless stereo sound output (via the A2DP Bluetooth profile) is also supported, and stereo audio output is also supported by the TV output feature and the on board stereo speakers.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The music formats supported include MP3, AAC, AAC+ and WMA.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Video playback on the QVGA screen is excellent and supported video formats include 3GP, Real Video and MP4 with support for the latest AVC codec.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The multimedia key now leads to a revamped application and multimedia shorcut view which now supports both a greater number of shortcuts (applications, multimedia files and bookmarks) and more flexible personalisation.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>As a result it  is now a more generic shortcut key mechansim and offers an alternative to the standard application launcher.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The N95 uses S60 3rd Edition Feature Pack 1 (Symbian 9.2) and as such includes version 2.0 of the open source Nokia web browser (supporting WML, XHTML and HTML in one browser), Flash Lite 2.0, FOTA (firmware over the air updates) and more.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The N95 uses the same small power port as other S60 3rd Edition devices, but the in-box charger is considerably smaller than the existing models (up to 60% smaller).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The N95 has a 950 mAh battery, it is likely that the N95 will require a daily charge with moderate to heavy use, although 3-6 days may be possible with lighter use (dependent on network strength, type and other factors).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The N95 will be available in Q1 2007 and the approximate unsubsidised price is ?550. Initially it will be available in the EMEA market.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It will not be officially available in the US although gray imports are very likely.</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>OMG i've recently bought the N95 & it's amazing!!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The reason i wanted this phone is because of its 5megapixel camera, its far superior than i was expecting, me favorite mode on the camera is the close up mode (obviously you can't use this mode to take all pictures).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>it gives great detail whilst slightly blurring the rest of the image which makes the object you're taking a picture of standout and really gives it the wow factor.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The let down is the poor battery life, but i don't really find charging it a hard ship every night, its not like you have to sit there & watch it!.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Just a word of advice though, if you're going away for the night it'd be a good idea to take the charger with you, you don't want to get caught out with no battery left!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I haven't really had that much of a chance to look into the sat nav in any great depth, but i did try and figure out how it worked, but being a guy I refuse to look at instructions unless i really have to, and i cant be bothered to look in the Nokia booklet ATM, so when the time arises that i need to use it, I'll result in looking in the book!.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The pre-installed ring tones are rubbish so its worth putting on you're own music and setting them as you're tones.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The speakers on the phone are great, nothing amazing, but as good as you can get really for a phone (i think).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So all in all i think the Nokia N95 is a great phone and worth having, its a bit pricey, but with all the features its got crammed in it, its well worth the money & also saves on having a Phone, MP3 player, sat nav etc...</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>When i was looking for a new phone, i was stuck between having the Sony Erickson K850 (when it was released) or this the N95, and because i mainly wanted it for the camera, I looked for comparisons between the two phones picture taking qualities, and I must say the Nokia excelled greatly compared to the SE.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I think its because its got a 16m colour screen as apposed to having a 256k colours.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In darker shots though the SE was much better due to it having a better/brighter flash, but the Nokia's flash isn't awful!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Anyway to sum it up, if the Nokia N95 is tempting you, then just have it!!</sentcont></sentence>

<reviewtitle>One phone to suit all your needs</reviewtitle>
<rating>0.7</rating>
<pro><sentence>
<sentcont> Great connectivity and wide range of software change the way you use the internet</sentcont>
</sentence></pro>
<con><sentence>
<sentcont> Low Battery Life, Easily heated up during long calls or VoIP calls, Music player errors, GPS cant connect, 2-way slider</sentcont>
</sentence></con>
<freereview><sentence><sentcont>I eagerly awaited the launch of this phone and got it on the first day of launch.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It was great in terms of design.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Although in many ways it looks like a brick, compared to the N80, the N95 is slimmer and lighter and packs more features.The</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>best part was the wifi connectivity it offered.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Although in terms of battery life, you may not be able to sustain the handphone while surfing wirelessly all day, it did change the way i used the internet.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Booking tickets online was a breeze (i could just connect in a hotspot at starbucks).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I could still be on MSN while away from my computer.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I used the VoIP whenever i could find a hotspot, thus saving on hefty phone bills through free calls.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>There were many.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Surely the E65 would have offered me the same wifi advantages plus a longer battery life, but this was running on Symbian OS 9.2 and had a larger and clearer display.The</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>2-way slider was great when it came to viewing videos.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Having such a large screen and speakers that could go real loud, it was almost an ipod video by itself.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I rarely used the music player buttons however and the only reason i found myself sliding the other way often is to rotate the display view.The 5 megapixel camera is a godsend.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Although i could not really take clear pictures compared to a normal 7megapix camera, it was great for a camera phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The bigger deal was the video.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Videos have never been this clear on a camera phone before.I didn't try using the visual radio service as i wanted to avoid any GPRS charges so as to keep my bill as low as possible.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So far my bill dropped by about 30% with VoIP calls and wifi surfing instead of GPRS.Here comes the sad news - This phone can be equally as bad.I used it almost as i would use PC.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Although i cannot view videos on youtube, i was able to download some and view on the realplayer.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>While i was at it, once i stumbled upon some 50mb video.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Halfway through the download i was worried if the phone could support such a large file and cancelled the download.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>My web became inaccessible.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Everytime i clicked on web, it would auto-close application.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Even after a few restarts the phone was still the same.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I then had to install a browser software to clear the cache (the root of the problem).Another</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>major problem is that the N95 auto-closes applications when they are not in use for a small period of time.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Supposing you were in the middle of a game and had to attend a 2 minute call.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Once you're done, your game has already been closed.I also had some embarrassing moments with the Music player.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I'm happy that it came with the headphone jack.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>However, when i accidentally loosened the connection between the jack and the phone, the music player automatically switched to speakers and started blasting my music in public.Another</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>problem was that when using the provided earphones with the music control, the music is momentarily played on the speaker for a second or two when you're switching tracks while playing the music.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Yet another embarrassing moment.The 2 way slider is another big problem.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So much for advertising "What's in your pocket?" when the phone is so pocket unfriendly.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Imagine this, when the phone is put inside the jeans pocket, it tends to slide upwards to reveal the keypad since the slider is that smooth.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It slides the other way when it is removed from the pocket.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So usually when i take it out, the display is in landscape mode and that makes me look unprofessional sliding my phone all the time.My 1.5 month old N95 recently went for repairs after the display light died.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The phone was still perfectly working.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Just the display backlight.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It was a slow death from the heavy usage from someone like me.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Thankfully there's a firmware upgrade for this phone and i hope it will solve some of the many problems for the N95.</sentcont></sentence>

<reviewtitle>1st Class Phone</reviewtitle>
<rating>0.9</rating>
<pro><sentence>
<sentcont> Great all-round device that does everything </sentcont>
</sentence></pro>
<con><sentence>
<sentcont> Slight delays when using some functionality </sentcont>
</sentence></con>
<freereview><sentence><sentcont>Having read the editor's review you'd end up thinking that the phone didn't look that good, have great build quality or respond well, and possibly also that it wasn't the best thing since sliced bread.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The truth is that this is one of the best looking and feeling handsets out there.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The build quality is very solid and it's snappy for all the key phone functions.Having</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>used every kind of handset ranging from the Palm based Treo to a multitude of Windows and Series 60 phones over the recent years they've all fallen well short of being an ideal phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This is the first one which genuinely starts to deliver the goods.The</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>overall feel of using the N95 is that it is simply phenomenal and without doubt is a milestone in mobile phone development.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I'm fortunate to be based in London and get to benefit from all the 3G goodness and speed, and have to say that the browsing, navigation (GPS) and multimedia goodies such as playing the games on my wide screen television make this handset an unbelievably useful and fun device.Other</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>great features are the performance for syncing, it used to take ages to sync a Nokia phone, but this one syncs faster than you realise, so much so, that I've set it to auto sync via Bluetooth whenever it's near my laptop.The 3G connectivity means that surfing and emailing through the PC or N800 are now a joy on the move as well as in the office.The</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>other thing to note is that the connectivity in general and especially the Wifi works extremely well.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The phone seems to instantly detect wireless networks, at least three or four times faster than Windows and allows easy switching between the wifi and 3G connections allowing you to save on your bandwidth bill.What is clear though is that some of the functionality is in effect 'back-up' to dedicated devices.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I'd always prefer to take photos with a dedicated digital camera although the camera works very well in good light (although it is slow).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The GPS (Maps) application is great and the ability to drill down into street level in villages in Hungary (where my wife is from and currently visiting) is something I've never found before in a GPS device.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I would still use my Nuvi though to navigate around most of Europe since it does a great job and has a bigger screen.This is also the first Nokia which is 'standard' in that it has standard headphone jack and USB connectors.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It means it actually starts to feel like a tiny computer rather than simply a phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If you compare the performance of this device with PCs it comes on top in all kinds of scenarios.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The multi-tasking nature of the N95 is also great.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It allows you to flick through songs using the dedicated keys, whilst reading a travel guide and plotting your route to the next destination, all to be gently interrupted by an incoming call with a 3D ringtone which zooms from one side to the other.Having looked at some of the reviews and my own experience, and compared them with the editor's review it's clear that the editor has got this one seriously wrong.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I can appreciate that there's a couple of disadvantages in using the handset in the US but even then the general performance should simply blow you away.There's no device that comes close to this phone as an all-round handy device which really works.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It certainly means I'll be carrying a lot fewer devices on a day-to-day basis</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>Hands on with the N95   ------------------------------------------    Hey hi ppl....</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I had the chance of playin wid an N95.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>! So here goes:.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Build Quality:.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Well my first impressions of the build quality is that its very acceptable.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>the only thing bad was the slide and the keypad, when under it making a lil movement.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>as in you could feel the space between the top and the keypad when the phone was closed.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>just a lil n minor though.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>may b because of the rough handling ppl might have given or what i aint sure but i'll give nokia the benefit of the doubt!.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The slide is good both ways... really...!!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It firmly clicks in place in both directions...</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The force u need to apply to open it is optimum.. neither too hard or soft... it wont open in ur pocket.. the feelin the slide gives u pushing it down is amazin !! The buttons there too are good...</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>All in all very good build quality apart from the slight creaking which might b due to rough handling as i already said.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Screen & Illumination:   The screen gives u quite a wow feeling.. it does look big.. there was N91 8GB lying near it n the diffirence was huge!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The pixels too aint much of an issue... of course it aint a N80 but it aint really less too!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Giving up pixels for size is accepatble any day to me.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The keypad and the sides illuminate rather well.. the blue contrasts nicely..</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The illumination of the side camera, review n vol.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>key is also pretty smart... Adds a fine touch...     Camera & Flash:   The camera as u ppl might have already seen on you tube takes a lil time to load and work around it... but it already is producing good pics... i tried clickin a few and sendin onto my phone but it rebooted often...</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So i wasnt sucessful there.. Damn!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The LED is indeed a powerful one!!!!!!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It works like a normal flash used in cameras i.e. flashin multiple times while clickin one pic...</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This seemed to be one beautiful addition... N should give the SE Xenon flash junkies a kick... i aint sure of how it would b in the night as the area was brightly lit up... But way better that any existin nokia!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Audio:   The audio from the loudspeakers is good!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I beamed the tokyo drift song onto it from my phone to play n the stereo start is sexy!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>However it seemed to me that the output which is pretty loud, doesn't seem to support much bass.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>the sound was a lil sharp.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But i may b mistaken as there were huge JBL speakers blasting music on the sides so compared to that bass.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>!.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The output from the Bose headphones that were there too was amazin!.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>A true music phone whose only folly is the micro sd!     Keys:   The keypad is very usable n the key size is enough even for big fingers.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Specially the way they come up is nice.. Fast T9 not a problem.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The camera open slide was pretty hard... really took an effort.. a lil crude i'd say.. hope it improves in the final product.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The camera, review & vol.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>keys are okay.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Software:.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The software in its current state is buggy.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>a lot of frequent restarts.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>one think that they've changed is that the menu loads while booting n the press of the menu key after startup gives u instant access unlike the earlier phones.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Menu workin is pretty fast too.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>applicatons start quickly.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The Maps application has a nice start to it.. kinda like google earth... But it wasnt workin here... alas!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Game (3D Acc.):</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The reason ive made a special mention is because the feelin of playin that spaceship game is excellent... it works like a charm... no glitches, lags etc at all!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>PSP kinda stuff!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>3D acceleration at its best!!!! Super Sexy!!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Once programmers start using the music keys in games it'll just b great!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>N if they orient the display somehow that the keys come to the right it'll even b better!!!!!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It was mighty impressive... !</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Proto to Final:   The proto software is not really final yet owing to the reboots etc.. but its pretty close!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>3rd party apps like adobe reader are up n running....</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I dont think there should b anythin Nokia wont b able to fix within the next 3 months.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Q1 2007 is realistic.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Feb n wide availiability at a stable price shouldn't b a prob.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>!.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>General Impressions:.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Its a great device to hold.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>fits nicely in the hand.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>the highlight is the screen but there are others too specially the dual slide.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>the quality of the plastic could have been better for such a premiem device not that its bad now.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>a responsive UI exists.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Awe inspiring if u aint the one holdin it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It'll blow over the non geeks too.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>!.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>MY NEXT PHONE.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>!.</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>I switched over from SE phones to N95 and at first I did not like it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It felt like I was lost and never used a mobile phone before.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Also camera was very slow.after a couple days of playing arouund with N95 I was in love!Everything was great except the lag on the camera.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Push a button and it would take 3 seconds to actually take the picture.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So i had numerous pics of my daughter looking the other way.I updated the firmware through Nokia and now the camera is very quick like it should have been from the beginning.GPS is great!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I suggest paying extra for Turn by Turn Nav.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It works great!WIFI is also awesome.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I can surf the internet from my couch, no need for the laptop.I still love SE phones but I'm really loving this Nokia N95!</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>27 September 2006 - Launching around the globe on the same day, Nokia has opted for one big hit rather than pacing the launch of its latest products over several weeks or months.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Pocket-lint managed to get a brief first look at its "Hero" phone, the Nokia N95 expected to be available in February 2007 at the UK launch event in Soho, London.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>While even the Nokia spokesman keen to show us the phone professed that he had seen it for as long as we had, our initial first impressions are very good.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Quoting Simon Ainslie the new Managing Director of Nokia, who recently joined from operator T-Mobile "There isn't much that it doesn't do" and when you look at the phone's features we, like Nokia, are hard pressed to see what's missing; 5 megapixel camera, 3G, wireless connectivity, dedicated music buttons, HDSPA, even GPS and bar missing a QWERTY keyboard you're pretty much there.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Nokia has even gone as far as using the slogan ?It?s what computers have become".</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Wanting to be more than just another phone, the device comes with a dedicated maps application that includes maps for more than 100 countries and covers more than 15 million points of interest on a separate CD that you load into the phone depending on what you need and where you are.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In our brief encounter we weren't able to see the GPS element in action.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The more conventional, but far from ordinary, is the announcement that the phone packs in a 5 megapixel camera boasting a Carl Zeiss lens, but no zoom.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Nokia isn't the first to announce a hike in megapixel count, LG and Samsung are already all over that one, but it's good to see that Nokia isn't prepared to be left behind.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Unfortunately we weren't able to take any images away with us to see the quality, but the interface looked similar to other Nokia camera handsets and the 2.6-inch QVGA 16 million colour display screen certainly gives you a camera feel.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Luckily Nokia seems to have resisted the urge to put a rather large lens cover a la the K800i from Sony Ericsson instead opting for a robust, but thin lens cover which does the job just as well.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Other features include HSDPA, or 3.5G, the N95 also supports WLAN, EDGE, and WCDMA networks, 3D graphics, built-in stereo speakers, a 3.5mm audio jack, a microSD card slot, and mini USB socket.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So it must be a brick, like the N93 - "the size of a house" one Journalist next to us asked - well actually it's rather small, slightly bigger than the N71 but still very compact and bijou.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Bored with the clamshell, candy bar or regular slider, the N95 enlists a triple slide function - up for the numerical keypad, down for the dedicated music keys, which are, in the model we looked at, slightly hidden and rubbery to touch.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The main keypad itself is, thankfully, rather staid and boring and Nokia has resisted the temptation as with previous models to make you jump through a series of hoops to simply dial a number.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The front of the slider, aside from the large screen that dominates the design features call, hang up and select buttons as well as the menu button with its strange icon (now in its third year) and a multimedia button that zooms you to the multimedia features.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Nokia users will also be pleased to hear that the interface looks identical to current models and the Finnish company hasn't chosen this moment in time to do anything too drastic here either.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>VERDICT  The form factor hasn't changed much over previous models (apart from the extra sliding function), however what has changed is Nokia's emphasis and embracement of every technology that you can manage to fit into a small device.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In the past, when phone manufacturers have mentioned convergence, it's normally that they've managed to get an camera or MP3 player into there phone and boosted the memory a bit.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Here Nokia has managed to not only cram that camera (all 5 megapixels) and MP3 player (with new accompanying music service) in to the phone, but it's gone one step further and added a plethora of connectivity features and GPS to boot making this a multimedia fan's ultimate fantasy.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>What's even more impressive is, that unlike the N73, which looks like a Sony Ericsson Walkman rip off, or the N93, which with its built-in camcorder is bigger than you would perhaps want, the final design is small compact.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Will this replace all Sony Ericsson's handsets (the K800i, the M600i and the W810i) in one foul swoop?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Time will tell come launch day, however based on our initial brief encounter, if the features perform under closer scrutiny, then Nokia might finally see themselves back on top once again.</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>I got the N95 a few days ago in Singapore for US$580 (without contract will be US$845).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>And after playing with it, would like to share my opinions:  *I have 3 phones - the Nokia 5500, N73 and now the N95.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Camera: N95 is the best of the 3. Great for daytime shots.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Flash not powerful enough for night shots.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Still does not replace a seperate digital camera, until they include an optical zoom, and a better flash    Phone: works great as a phone of course.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Clear sound, lots of options to customise the quick keys, back light etc.(typical symbian phone)    Screen: Nice big screen,numbers on the display are big enough.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Resolution is very high.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>DVD quality movie playback    Keypad: good sized keys for SMS.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>dual slider audio control buttons a little small    Slider: smooth slider.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>would prefer a lock to hold the slider in place when wearing jeans.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>no issues with normal pants.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Other complain is when you slide open the audio controls, the display shifts to a landscape mode.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>but when you close the slider, it stays landscape; and you have to slide open the keypad again to return back to potrait.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Nokia should have added a button to switch back to potrait.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Video: proccesor has a graphics accelerator, i stored DVD movies on the phone and the movies were very clear with good sound.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Stored the same movie on the N73, and it did not work, i believe the N73 proccesor could not handle it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>(average 2 hr movie in 3gp format will take up 400mb)    MP3 player: good sound quality, they have changed to a 3.5mm jack for headsets, so you can use any after market headphones.</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>Well, I've noticed John alert down there about how inferior N95 is compare to SE products and i also just want to clarify a few things.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Most of us know that Nokia dominate the mobile market for the last few years and their phones are still doing greats.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Nokia N series has always been the most superior class of phone on the market so far that set the standard for most modile phones out there.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So in term of function, reliability and east of use, not to mention Design are all perfect on the N series.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Personally, i am a samsung user and I have to say samsung havent made anything as outstanding as the N series or some of the SE.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So i think i can be very fair when i comment on these two brands.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Nokia N95 has been release recently and so far most of the people and users that I've talk to who actually own one or played with one  had response with great satisfaction in the product.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>N95 is a great unit with quadband, and compatible with all types of connection.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It allow you to play different types of music media and some popular forms of video files.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>As if that wasnt enough, the N95 threw in tha auto focus 5mp as bonus and internal gps system that can navigate quite well for a phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Design are quite interesting and the ease of use are very satisfying.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>As for the body of the phone, it have a very well study built, yes study built.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It havent made any racketing noises and weird sounds like some people claim that it made on my friends N95.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If you are afraid of strange noises on your phone, then i would like to suggest you check your phone before buying it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>To me, when I tested it the phone was great.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If it feel slugglish in function by any chance, maybe some of you didnt turn off all the extra applications you have opened.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The more applications running at once the slower the phone will be (like a computer right?).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The other functions on these phones are very convenience and i find the phone exceptionally entertaining.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It works with majority of the services like cingular, tmobile and so on.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I havent heard anyone who used the aN95 complaining about the phone freezes and turn off by itself unless it is out of battery.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Some said it have bad battery life, well i would like note that the N95 does have a 2.6in screen (if you check majority of the other phones that are over 2.5inches screen they all have pretty bad battery life).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Not only that, the N95 play all sort of things, if you buy this phone and constantly using it for mp3 and video and gps throughout the WHOLE day then please expect the battery to run out, nothing can take that much heavy duty work, so with that big of a screen and that much function, i think the N95 does a GOOD job with the 6.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>5 hours talk time =).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Over all i think its a superb phone and the built and functions are all great.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Now lets see SE. SE have been doing the same design over and over again, BAR phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I do admit some SE are great.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>However, some SE have problem with their phones.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Ive try several of them and it turn out some are fine, some are frozen after a while.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>SE try so hard to make their navigation screen pretty that it caused the device to freeze often.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I've been hearing complain about it with the W800 and K series.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>SE also out all their best units on a phone just trying to make it sell.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>things such as Cybershot, walkman model, and so on.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I think its great that they put those in to the phone as bonus but seriously, against a 5mp, they are seriously messing with the wrong phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I think sony have great sound for a phone, and the style look a lot like a camera and thats very impressive.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>but it would be nice to get out of the bar form once in a while.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Internal gps would be nice and maybe some more connection compatibility.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If what john said about SE releasing after Nokia is true, then that would make me think SE is just another company that try to imitate another brand that is successful, but i try not to go there since I believe sony is a good company that can come up with some sophisticated design on their own.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Sony got a study built body and i like that.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The phone is compact and not too large with fairly nice weight.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The screen and navigation is nice.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The menu are fairly simple to use and the camera are quite impressive if compared with other 2mp camera.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Wifi has been something new to SE and they dont seem to support that a lot.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Same to audio and video files compatibility as well.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But over all i think SE is a great middle class phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Its fun to use and battery life is slightly a bit more than N95 but with a small screen and not a lot of function to play with, i guess its okay because it does cost cheaper than the high class N95.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Over all, both phone are superb but in preference, i would rather own an N95 than the Sony series.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>N95 is now known as the world most high tech and sophisticated Multimedia device as of now, so i think that title wasnt given to the N95 for no reason.</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>Hello Friends,  Please consider all the above few negative points before buying.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This is a truth for N95    No Touch screen?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I think Nokia is not confident in making touch screen mobiles or they want to make profit, anyway we are forced to use the old keypad.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>You cannot see the screen in bright sun, the screen get blackened make poor visibility even the display brightness is set to 100%.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Battery backup less than a day, if you use wlan/mp3.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If not using battery charge will last for hardly 2 days Application manager hangs the phones several times.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This is a serious issue, most of the customer doesn't know sis support not there.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>only sisx n jar support.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>No USB charging, only thr 230v supply, cannot charge ur cell from laptop.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>See Sony Errision & Motorola, how good in charging the battery using USB.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Bluetooth paring is too slow n transfer speed is too slow.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This is applicable for those who use bluetooth in data transfer You cannot transfer files via blutooth more than 160MB in old N95.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I don't know about new N95.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Camera lens is not covered in new N95, Old one have a projected cover.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Accumulation of dirt n getting scratch in lens area in ur precious 5 mp camera.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Accessories are too costly.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>keypad will get loosen very fast, no life for the keypad, nokia have to do some thing for this.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Without good keypad whatz the use of mobile.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Not user friendly for browsing net in wireless lan.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>keypad problem.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Poor battery life, depends on the usage above said.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>No option to kill the application, if the phone hangs, u need to remove the battery to reboot.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This is shame for all N serie.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Sim card is behind the battery.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Can't turn off the network when phone is switched on.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Advantage for  Motorola new series like Rockr E6. small keypad make it difficult in typing.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Calender entry is not as user friendly.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Battery backup only 2 days.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Talktime 4 hrs.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Mp3 only 5 hrs.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Call are getting rejected frequently when the buttons gets pressed inside the pocket, even the phone is locked.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Phone will dial itself in pocket, if it is not key pad locked.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Sliding get loosed so fast.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>mine was loosened in a month use.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Interfacing N95 with our pc/laptop is very tedious, It take time for both in bluetooth n thr USB.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Transfer rate through USB is slow.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Battery cover is too thin, the clip can get break easily.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Thickeness is more for this cell(21mm).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>TV out, audio output fails.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>video does'nt hva good quality in TV Out.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>FM Sound output is too low.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Bass Boosting is not good.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>U will not feel the boosting in bass.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Overall feature ratings are poor.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I will rate 6 of 10. Need more features like Business card reader, Office editor, USB charging, touch screen, FM stereo output.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Office word will not show pictures n tables, No power management feature, Video flickers and drags in night mode, slow bluetooth n USB tansfer, No body think that you will clear pictures always in its 5 mp camera, its not a digital camera, its a mobile.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Why am telling this, I have compared Sony 5 mp digital camera pictures with that of N95 5mp pictures.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The picture clarity is for Sony's 5 mp cam though one picture size is 4.5MB jpeg, whereas the picture size of N95 5mp picture is 800Kb max in jpeg (less than 1MB).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Here it goes, the jpeg picture quality is reduced if the picture is compressed less than 1 MB. N95 could retain the actual picture quality rather goes for image compression loosing the jpeg informations.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>There is no option to vary the compression or settings to improve the picture quality with increase in size of each captured image.</sentcont></sentence>

</sentence></pro>
<con><sentence>
<sentcont> Battery life poor, but it is fine w/ a nightly recharge, not made of anodized aluminum </sentcont>
</sentence></con>
<freereview><sentence><sentcont>This phone does everything imaginable.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's pretty much a full computer in your pocket.Camera:5MP is phenomenal for a cell phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It also has many advanced functions such as aperture settings, exposure compensation, white balance, self timer, and red-eye flash settings.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>On top of that, the video camera is very very good but not DVD quality as Nokia says.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It even has image stabilization built in.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In other reviews, you may have read that the "camera was slow" or something along those lines.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The truth is that the shutter itself is not slow, but the response time between pushing the button and the clicking of the shutter is long.GPS: Really useful and neat feature to have.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Be sure to clear all maps first using the PC map loader (if it was not bought in the US--mine was an Asian model) Then load your US maps into the memory card.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The map goes down to street level and is fairly up-to-date.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The accuracy of the GPS is around 150 feet.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It even indicates altitude and speed of your vehicle.Video/Music Playback:The media centre of this phone has some impressive animation, and plays videos and songs in stereo sound with impressive quality.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Plus, it can be hooked up to any TV so you can blow it up on a larger screen.WiFi:Fairly good.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Regular sites don't load as fast as a normal comp, but that's because of the overall processing power/RAM of the unit.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>WiFi also saves you on expensive data costs that you would prob encounter with your wireless carrier.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's really useful for checking email and browsing your favorite sites.Bluetooth:The</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>EDR really helps when you sync your media files from your computer.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It also helps increase the range between your computer and the N95.User interface:The Symbian OS is very intuitive and clean.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Occasionally, it lags but this wasn't a big issue for me.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Even more complex apps like the Map application loads and quits efficiently without hanging up.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The unit only freezes after applying a more complex setting such as changing the system theme or something.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It can be fixed by a simple restart of the device.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>However, this should've been fixed by Nokia through a simple message telling you to restart your device the way you'd restart your computer after installing an update or program.Battery:This</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>seems to be a big point of critisism for the editors and other users of this phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The honest bottom line is this: it doesn't go about 14 hrs without a recharge.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>(that is w/ use of WiFi, GPS, and Bluetooth).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If you use the phone just for talking w/ idling, the battery lasts a comfortable 21 hrs.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The best thing to do is to probably charge it overnight daily.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Then you'll be fine.PDA</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>functionality:The address book, calandar, and document viewers are excellent.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Multiple numbers per contact w/ room for email addresses, home addresses etc.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The calandar has many options for appts, meetings, and alarms.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The document viewer not only opens regular text docs, but also spreadsheets and some kind of file that resembles PowerPoint.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Checking email is also easy as setting up your account with the wizard is a snap.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It works of WiFi or through your wireless carrier.Screen:The</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>size is really nice and the important info such as time, date, etc show up nice and large so it's easy to read.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>For videos and the GPS, it's perfect.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The ambient light sensor works well.Physical</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>feel:The phone has a solid feel.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's also slimmer than it looks.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>When I saw the pics on the Nokia site, it def looked thicker than when I actually had the unit in my hand.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The fact that the sliding mechanism isn't assisted isn't a big deal for me.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The two-way slider is also pretty neat.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>However, the slider, when open, has a slight flimsy feel to it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's also made of plastic, and not anodized aluminum like a lot of new electronics (eg.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>iPod) which is surprising for such a high-tech device.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The plastic is wrapped tightly and solidly around the device though and doesn't "squeak" or "creak" when being handled.Overall, this phone is really THE THING as it surpasses the typical smartphone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Despite a few minor faults, it is an amazing device with tremendous functionality.</sentcont></sentence>

<sentence><sentcont>Just help me learn how to use more of it better?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I would have rated a 5/5 apart from the small issues I have outlined.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>A) Nokia needs to support thte product more drectly and through the carriers.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>B) Easier App's acquisition than scouring the internet and filtering every Symbian App.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>C) Main buttons could be a tad larger for easier control with one hand.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Maybe these have all been resolved on the N96?</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>Till today I have never had the courage to name any phone like the best one on the market with clear conscience.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But Nokia N95 does deserve this label.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It has no adequate competitors on the current mobile market: it is extremely rich in functions, has a comfortable and detailed user interface with plenty of settings, and on the top of it, it is a relatively light and compact.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The most notable drawback of Nokia N95 is its battery life.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It will require daily doses of power, unless you limit its usage to occasional calls and messages, deactivate 3G, Wi-Fi, and GPS, and play no videos.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In this case you may happen to postpone charging by a couple of days, but is such use worth the purchase of a phone like Nokia N95?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The answer is no.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Of course, battery life is an individual matter and depends on many factors.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Nevertheless we can assure you that during our intensive tests we had no other option but to charge the device sometimes even twice a day.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The first batch of Nokia N95 hit the market at a high price.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Even so it was immediately sold out.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The main delivery whose price is said to be a bit lower is being expected at the end of April.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Anyway, the price remains rather high, perhaps due to the strong customer demand.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Nokia N95 may be very expensive, but it also offers a lot and thus keeps attracting numerous prospective buyers.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In this sequence of thoughts it is quite probable that in a few months, when the initial ecstasy falls off, the price of the phone will also fall down a bit.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Be prepared, however, that drops in price will hardly be significant as Nokia N95 will continue to be the best phone in the world for a while and will thus manage to easily maintain its price.</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>GOOD:??The Nokia N95 cell phone boasts a 5-megapixel camera that produces good-quality photos and videos.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It comes with advanced multimedia capabilities and has a 3.5mm headphone jack.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The Symbian smart phone also features integrated GPS, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth, and an innovative two-way slider design.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>??BAD:??The N95 lacks support for U.S. 3G networks; standby battery life is poor; and performance is somewhat sluggish.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The hardware feels a bit cheap, and the sliding mechanism could be more secure.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's also very expensive.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>??BOTTOM LINE:??With a 5-megapixel camera, advanced multimedia capabilities, and GPS, there's no doubt that the Nokia N95 is one of the most feature-packed smart phones to date, but poor battery life and sluggish performance make it hard to justify the high price tag.</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>wow thanks for the compliment sir dani hehehe.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>sir lattroteuse, sorry to hear about your unfortunate experience about nokia and the n95, hopefully they will sort it out.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>maybe you can file a complaint at nokia.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>com.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>?.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>dear sir arepeaceDNA,.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>first you can only turn off the camera sound completely if you have a euro1 euro2 or balkan firmware version (just turn the "warning tone" off).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>if you have an asian one or from the U.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>S.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>you may not be able to turn off the sound, there are ways to reflash your unit to euro1 or euro 2 or even balkan firmware though so you can turn the camera sound off.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>or you can just download the application "ccam" it lets you use the camera with no camera sound nor red light.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Quite cool hehehe just search it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>its a free application btw hehehe.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>btw.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>if you have firmware 20 and above, you will notice a significant improvement of the battery life and the super speed of the phone overall ehehe.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>in my case I use my n95 extensively, so I kinda charge it every night.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>my battery is depleted once I use the phone for 6-8 hours.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>used for gaming(most of the time), viewing videos, and using the camera etc.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>and if your phone doesnt vibrate even when its on.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>i think you have a defective battery.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>sir gana,.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>you have every right to change your phone to whatever you choose, If it will make you feel better to change your n95 for an n82 then by all means please do so and you are entitled for your opinion, You can say that n82 is superior(which in some factors, crucial to others, yes it is ).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>but n95 holds its own against n82, minute details that makes the n95 worth considering compared to the n82.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>in terms of flash, xenon is bar none definitely the most powerful and most suited for photography, but using the xenon flash extensively.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>drains the battery big time.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>and in macro or close up scenes.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>there is a high chance you'd get overexposed pics because of the powerful light of xenon.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>whilest on the n95s case, the modest light that the underated led flash emits is really good at macro and closeups, AND you can use it extensively at close intervals in between usage unlike xenon.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>and n95's led flash is one of the most powerful led flashes around beating that of the dual led flash of w960(google it).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>n95 has a bigger screen you can toy around its construction as it is dual slide with bigger and more keys.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>has infrared not as useable for file transfers as bluetooth but you can use it for certain applications such as tv remote.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>motion detector etc has a comprehensive video editing suite on board the phone (which the n82 nor the n95 8gb doesnt have).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>to some, n95 has an edge in form factor over the n82.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>to some n82 is just too classy to compare it to the n95.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>ultimately its your choice no one is stopping you from going with what you want.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>but to n95 users.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>apparently n95 is "the phone" and is simply the better choice.</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>Im thinking whether I should get a N95, N95 8GB, N81 8GB or N76.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Camera doesnt matter to me.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I see no practical use for a 5Mpix camera, so 2Mpix is more than enough for me.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But I want that DVD-like quality video recording & TV out.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Thats awesome.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Music matters most for me.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>N95 has all of these but its software is kind of outdated already.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Plus Im afraid of N95's loose slider.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The N76 has better audio quality through the 3.5mm jack, faster processor, larger RAM, newer software & cheaper than N95 but doesn't have GPS, HSDPA, WiFi.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Well, who needs GPS that takes ages to work?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Huh?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But N95 again has stereo speakers but not so impressive audio quality through 3.5mm jack.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>N95 8GB has everything, except the fastest processor, but it's too pricey.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>N81 8GB is just so cool.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Its the perfect slider Ive seen.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I think its perfect for music.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I just hope that its sound through 3.5mm jack is the same as N91 cuz N91 has the best audio quality so far.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But N81 8GB has no TV out, HSDPA.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I dont care about GPS.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I wont be needing that.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>N95 & N76 both support 4GB & 6GB microSDHC cards.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>N95 8GB & N81 8GB has already large built in memory.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>N76 has better sound than N95 at least through 3.5mm jack.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>N95 has more extra features than N76.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>They say N81 8GB has same audio quality as N91.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But it's not yet out so nobody can really confirm.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>N95 8GB is just too ambitious.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Im really torn.</sentcont></sentence>

<sentence><sentcont>not bad.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>bat wait the n95 video record at a 640x480 size with 30fps in mpeg4 format.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>theres a big diffrens from the video size and almost a slight diffrens in the quality.</sentcont></sentence>

<sentence><sentcont>thats y dont under estimate the sound quality of the n95 in a mono format with an AAC sounds. the sounds is great.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>in terms in the picture quality the 5 mega pixel is a big diffrens from the 3 mega.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>the picture taken from the n95 is compressed but with the high quality pic taken from it. it means less space and a sharp picture.</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>Nokia N95 is the best mobile phone so far.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But let me point these out.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>According to many reviews, 5MP pics taken by N95 is no match to those 3.2MP pics taken by N93/N73/K800i due to too much JPEG compression in N95's shots.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>N93 (not N93i) takes an overall better video recording than N95/N93i.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>N93 records video with the same 30 fps MPEG4 (like the N95/N93i), but in "stereo" AAC audio encoding.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>N95 (as well as N93i) records in "mono" AAC audio only.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The reason - the N93 has 2 separate microphones.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The N95/N93i has only a single microphone used for audio encoding.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In music playback, N95's audio quality (headphones-wise) is no where near N91.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Reason - N95 is a "music-capable phone", not a "music phone"!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Technically speaking, N95 cannot produce a very sweet, rich & clear sound like the N91 mainly because the N95 doesn't have what N91 does have - 2 dedicated audio chips installed in its hardware namely, ASIC N2200 & N2000.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Of course, you can't have it all.</sentcont></sentence>

<reviewtitle>An awesome all in one device!</reviewtitle>
<rating>1.0</rating>
<pro><sentence>
<sentcont> Exellent MP3 + video + radio player with high quality sound and good bass (using a Phillip earphone), handle 3D games smoothly, GPS very accurate (I live in an urban/city area: Fairfax VA, US) </sentcont>
</sentence></pro>
<con><sentence>
<sentcont> If I have to chose..</sentcont>
<sentcont>I would say battery</sentcont>
<sentcont>It last very long for light use, but for heavy use of GPS, Wifi and Bluetooth the battery would drain before the day end</sentcont>
<sentcont>Oh, and no qwerty keyboard</sentcont>
</sentence></con>
<freereview><sentence><sentcont>I spend so much money on phones, and all of them end up disapointing me in some point ~ except this piece of marvel!It's black and sexy, and it feel very nice in my palm.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Not so small or thin, but it's not so wide and thick like those HTC PDA/phones.The audio sounds great on this device!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The iPhone audio will distord if the song have too much bass, but this phone plays great audio!Most other phone I have to compress the video size down to the point I can't see what's playing or suffering laging while playing, but this phone Play high quality videos smoothly without any problem.GPS is very accurate!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's a GPS of it own so I don't have to worry about paying extra for data services like my other gps phones.Wow,</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I've found the one LOL, this baby is for keeping!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>(I think at least for two years, you know how technology are outdated so fast)Transfering speed (between computer and phone using USB cable) can be slow for large files.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I recomended using defragment tool on your computer to defrag the phone every now and then.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It helps.</sentcont></sentence>
