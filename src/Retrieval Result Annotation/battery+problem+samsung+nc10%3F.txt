<reviewtitle>I absolutely love the Samsung NC10!</reviewtitle>
<rating>1.0</rating>
<freereview><sentence><sentcont>This netbook was exactly what i was looking for: compact, inexpensive, good quality, trusted name-brand, asthetically pleasing, the list goes on and on.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I looked and looked for netbooks on many websites such as Walmart.com, Amazon, and Bestbuy.com.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I did research on the netbooks at the time, and this was one that kept coming up with the top reviews.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I absolutely love it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>There isn't much that I can find wrong with it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The screen size is a little small if youre not used to it, but thats the way all netbooks are.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>A feature i love about this model is the font increase mode: you spread your fingers farther apart on the mouse-pad and the font becomes larger; pull your fingers closer together and the font becomes smaller.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Its very nice.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It has plenty of memory, a nice built in camera, and a nice keyboard.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The battery lasts a long time, and for the price you pay, you are really getting a deal for this one.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It is well worth it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Another thing that made me choose this netbook specifically was that it still had Windows XP.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I haven't heard very many good reviews on the new Windows running system, and I specifically wanted XP.</sentcont></sentence>

<sentcont> Very light and compact with normal-size keyboard keys (most keys are in the expected position but the left shift button is absent which can be problematic)</sentcont>
<sentcont>Sleek and stylish look - this has one of the best, if not the best appearance in comparison to other netbooks on the market</sentcont>
<sentcont>The thin metallic strips that runs around the circumference of the netbook is really a great touch</sentcont>
<sentcont>Good battery life - I have used this for 3-5 hours intensively before without charging</sentcont>
<sentcont>Without intensive use I imagine the battery could sustain itself for up to 8 hours as the manufacturer indicates (so no lies on their behalf)</sentcont>
</sentence></pro>
<con><sentence>
<sentcont> The Intel Atom is not a strong processor in comparison to normal laptops</sentcont>
<sentcont>To get an idea you could probably run Internet Explorer/Mozilla Firefox with 6 or 7 tabs/windows open and loading up to which point the processor would struggle to let you run any other serious application like an office application or mp3 player</sentcont>
<sentcont>However if you're buying a netbook then this is to be expected I guess</sentcont>
<sentcont>  Another major negative is some of the keyboard glitches and the finger pad design</sentcont>
<sentcont>There are a couple of keyboard glitches for instance if you hold Shift or Ctrl and touch the mouse pad it will zoom in/out as there is an in built mouse scroller (a stupid idea)</sentcont>
<sentcont>This can be frustrating when typing an email for instance as the zooming in/out actually requires quite a bit of memory and can take a while to correct</sentcont>
<sentcont>However there may be a way to disable this annoying feature I haven't yet checked</sentcont>
<sentcont>This problem is enhanced by having such a sensitive finger pad</sentcont>
<sentcont>The finger pad is also quite poorly sized, my main concern is that it is too short</sentcont>
<sentcont>The width of the pad is fine but most people who have used a normal laptop will struggle to adjust to the new shape (widescreen shape)</sentcont>
<sentcont> Overall I have been satisified with the Samsung NC 10 and have not encountered any major faults or design errors</sentcont>
<sentcont>I would recommend this netbook to someone who is looking for a stylish, highly portable computer and only wants to surf the net or use very basic applications (i.e</sentcont>
<sentcont>Microsoft Office)</sentcont>

<sentcont> The Samsung NC10 has plenty of good points, the most imporant of which are: its compact size, a very bright evenly lit screen, a nicely weighted keyboard with near full size keys, battery life of about 6 hours on near full screen brightness (maximum brightness is VERY bright), a good but not overly sensitive track pad with scrolling, 1 gigabyte of RAM - enough for Windows XP which is the supplied operating system and a 160 gigabyte SATA hard drive</sentcont>
<sentcont> There are 3 USB sockets, microphone and headphone sockets, a VGA socket and a Lan socket and a SD card slot - so plenty of connectivity</sentcont>
<sentcont>Wi Fi connectivity is very good</sentcont>
<sentcont>It feels solid and well put together (mostly - see below) and is fairly quiet running</sentcont>
<sentcont>I am pleased with it</sentcont>
</sentence></pro>
<con><sentence>
<sentcont> No real bad points but a few issues   the case on mine can creak a little even though the build quality is good overall</sentcont>
<sentcont>1 gig of RAM is not enough for Vista or Windows 7 which I have now installed so I have upgraded to 2 gig   a very easy task</sentcont>
<sentcont>The sound could be better   it is very low in output but I find this acceptable for such good portability and very high degree of usability</sentcont>

</sentence></pro>
<con><sentence>
<sentcont> The mouse/track pad can be a bit tricky/too sensitive as sometimes when navigating the the screen/image can be zoomed without untending to</sentcont>
<sentcont> Software should have come with MS Office at least with trial version if not the full version as it cannot be easily installed without having to use an external DVD/CD drive and downloading MS office is not an ideal option as only MS office 2010 is available online when given its operating system is Windows XP, it is better suited to MS office 2003</sentcont>
<sentcont>  Could have done better with internal mobile broadband SIM option and would have prefferred by having an extra USB port, totalling to 4 USB</sentcont>
<sentcont> Also the display, thought good, it could have done better with a much higher resolution as some programme and website requires this (though Samsung has explained of getting around this on its website)</sentcont>
<sentcont>  When starting netbook for the 1st time, it gives the option of partitioning the hard drive, but the option of determining the size of the drive can be easily be missed as it happened in my case, hence partitioning 50% of the entire drive which would sendomnly be used accept for recovery</sentcont>
<sentcont>This can distort the normal perception of having 160 GB hard drive</sentcont>

<sentcont> The NC10 is light, stylish and does everything i need</sentcont>
<sentcont>It is fast enough to cope with all internet applications and im able to get a good deal of work done from home now</sentcont>
<sentcont>I'm extremely pleased with it </sentcont>
</sentence></pro>
<con><sentence>
<sentcont> Screen can sometimes be a little small but decrease the magnifying size of windows and it is a lot easier to use</sentcont>
<sentcont>Remembering a notebook does not have a disc drive is also sometimes a problem</sentcont>
<sentcont>Battery life is probably the one big hold up with the NC10 with a full nights charge only giving two hours of battery life</sentcont>

<sentcont> Great little Netbook - very well designed</sentcont>
<sentcont>Fantastic screen, the keyboard is well layed out and with the bigger keys it's very easy to use</sentcont>
<sentcont>It's very light weight and compact, perfect size to take on the move</sentcont>
<sentcont>Absolutely delighted with this product would highly recommend it</sentcont>
</sentence></pro>
<con><sentence>
<sentcont> The Samsung Netbook cover provided isn't very good, I suppose it's OK as a dust cover</sentcont>
<sentcont>Had to buy a proper padded 10" Netbook case for better protection</sentcont>

<sentcont> Battery life excellent - will run for over 7 hours on full charge with light use, eg</sentcont>
<sentcont>surfing or word-processing</sentcont>
<sentcont>Screen is clear, evenly lit, bright and glare resistant</sentcont>
<sentcont>Sound through headphones is excellent</sentcont>
<sentcont>Keyboard is almost full size, and very nice to type on</sentcont>
<sentcont>My typing on this keyboard is actually slightly faster and more accurate than on a full-sized keyboard</sentcont>
<sentcont>Keys are sensibly positioned eg</sentcont>
<sentcont>'CTRL' is bottom left, 'Enter' key is good size and right-shift is easily found; much better than the keyboards on any other netbooks I looked at</sentcont>
<sentcont>Can be left on standby by closing lid and returned to the following day with no apparent loss of battery life - an excellent machine</sentcont>
<sentcont>SD / SD HC card slot useful for data backups</sentcont>
<sentcont>Wireless connection quick to connect from boot-up and has good range</sentcont>
<sentcont>There are numerous reviews of the NC10 on the web, mostly very positive; I haven't been disappointed</sentcont>
</sentence></pro>
<con><sentence>
<sentcont> Balance is slightly off   tends to tip backwards unless you support it correctly to compensate</sentcont>
<sentcont>Having used for a couple of weeks now though I soon adjusted to this and no longer find it a problem</sentcont>
<sentcont>Speakers are a bit weedy, but good enough for general use</sentcont>
<sentcont>If I want to listen to music then I generally use headphones anyway</sentcont>
<sentcont>No CD / DVD drive, but if you have another PC on your wireless network you can share the drives on that machine with the NC10 for data and applications</sentcont>

<sentcont> As someone who only needs a computer for E-mailing and going on the Internet, this is a great netbook</sentcont>

<con><sentence>
<sentcont> The mouse tracking pad is a bit small, and quite sensitive, but I've got round that by buying a proper mouse</sentcont>
<sentcont> The sound quality is a little dissappointing, but not a big problem as I didn't really buy it for listening or watching films</sentcont>
<sentcont> The main downfall, as with all other netbooks, is that the screen is obviously small, so not something I would want to use for extended periods of time</sentcont>

<sentcont> Looks great and works like a charm</sentcont>
<sentcont> I've had no drama's at all since purchasing my NC10, and out of the box it was ready to roll</sentcont>
<sentcont>Asthetically pleasing, and with a very nice feeling and responsive keyboard, the only one draw-back would have to be the limited space, positioning and feel of the touch-pad</sentcont>

<con><sentence>
<sentcont> The mouse touch pad is very small, and could do with a better edge to let the user know exactly where about their finger is without having to look down</sentcont>

<sentcont> very attractive functional net book with excellent battery life</sentcont>
<sentcont>I have upgraded the OS to windows 7, and upgraded RAM to 2Gb, bought a leather case and I finally extremely satisfied with my purchase</sentcont>
<sentcont>Also purchased logitech Bluetooth mouse which compensates slightly for the small trackpad</sentcont>
<sentcont>Very nice keyboard facilities and supplied samsung battery manager software gets the most out of the good battery</sentcont>

<sentcont> Small trackpad, antiquated OS, 10.2" screen required a lot of scrolling and the processor struggles with BBC iplayer</sentcont>

<sentcont> I have had Samsung NC10 for about 3 weeks now and it is a brilliant product</sentcont>
<sentcont> The battery life is about 6 hours, </sentcont>
</sentence></pro>
<con><sentence>
<sentcont> There are two only bad points</sentcont>
<sentcont> One is the screen does not go back beyond 45 degrees which can be frustrating depending on your seat position</sentcont>
<sentcont>Also when using an external monitor the vga out connection should have a screw connection to hold it in as this can easily fall out</sentcont>
<sentcont>If thinking of buying I would certainly consider the latest version of the NC10 which is available from the US but is slightly more expensive</sentcont>
<sentcont> The new NC20 is 2" bigger and starts to creep towards not being as portable as the NC10</sentcont>

<sentcont> When I was researching the Netbooks on the market, I found they tended to fall into two groups;   1)Nice keyboard</sentcont>
<sentcont>Shame about the screen</sentcont>
<sentcont> 2) Nice screen, shame about the keyboard</sentcont>
<sentcont>  I eventually realised that if I was going to live with the device for any period of time, I had better fork out the little bit extra for the Samsung NC10</sentcont>
<sentcont> For the size of netbook, the keyboard is superb</sentcont>
<sentcont>Unlike many of it's rivals, the NC10's 'RETURN' key is an inversed "L"</sentcont>
<sentcont>This makes typing much easier</sentcont>
<sentcont>It was one of the main reasons for buying this unit</sentcont>
<sentcont> The screen is also excellent</sentcont>
<sentcont>The brightness is lovely & punchy</sentcont>
<sentcont>The screen surface is slightly matt to reduce reflection</sentcont>
<sentcont>If you like your battery life long, let the supplied power-save programme controll the screen</sentcont>
<sentcont>It will run at full brightness when on mains power</sentcont>
<sentcont>But when on battery, it will dim the screen slightly and then dim it further after a period of non use</sentcont>
<sentcont>As a result, the already high powered battery gives excellent performance</sentcont>
<sentcont> The lid on the blue model has a lovely gloss finnish</sentcont>
<sentcont>Considdering it has a traditional hard drive, the NC10 is surprisingly quiet</sentcont>
<sentcont>The ram can be upgraded via a small access panel and the power pack is a nice size too</sentcont>
<sentcont> I have used it for about an hour every day and I can safely say I made the right decision</sentcont>
</sentence></pro>
<con><sentence>
<sentcont> The battery (although a nice shape) adds weight</sentcont>
<sentcont>But you cannot change the laws of physics</sentcont>
<sentcont>A better battery is a heavier battery</sentcont>
<sentcont>My previous laptop was a desk top emulating beast</sentcont>
<sentcont>So the NC10 does not really offend</sentcont>
<sentcont> Samsung have used a relatively proprietry power socket</sentcont>
<sentcont>This limits your choice of car chargers ect..</sentcont>
<sentcont>At least on the high street anyway</sentcont>
<sentcont> It's lovely that Samsung has supplied a free case, but a little bit of padding, on the bottom at least would have made it perfect</sentcont>

<sentcont> great battery life - about 6 hours, small in size, so that you can pack it in your bag - no need extra bag to carry</sentcont>
<sentcont>highly recommended to student like me - i can do my work in train, bring to university for presentation without aching your shoulder an so on</sentcont>
<sentcont>the price may be expensive compared to acer or asus, but it is fair enough for the quality of the manufacturer - samsung</sentcont>
