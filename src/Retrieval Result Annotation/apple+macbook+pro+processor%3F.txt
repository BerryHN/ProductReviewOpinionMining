<freereview><sentence><sentcont>In my opinion, Apple is a great company!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So far, I've had no problems with any of my Mac products!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The Macbook is creatively made so beautifully and very stylish!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The only disadvantage is the price, of course.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But other than that, I think it's worth paying for it because of the quality and the programming.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I find the applications, functions, everything is just so great.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I work really well with Macs.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I like how Macs are great at preventing VIRUSES.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>No viruses on my Macbook! ;) I like how they have lots of things that can also benifit you and your work, such as the Time Capsule, even though it's sold separately, but it's still great!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>There are many times where I've lost my work by accidently doing something wreckless.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So god bless Apple Inc. for the Time Capsule!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Also, don't forget about the Mouse Pad! Oh, how I LOVE the functions of it!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Much more easier to navigate through stop and you don't really have to use as much effort as before.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The magic mouse is great too!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Macs just makes things much easier to handle for me.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Thank you, Appl Inc.! Keep up to good work!</sentcont></sentence>

<reviewtitle>AHHH LOVE IT!</reviewtitle>
<rating>1.0</rating>
<freereview><sentence><sentcont>For the nearly 10 years I've been using computers, I was always a PC girl.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>When it was time for me to get a new laptop, I looked around at the trouble all my friends were having with their Dells, and HPs, and decided to splurge for something that was going to last.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>All of friends who use Mac rave about it, from its user-friendliness, to its longer useful life as compared to a PC, so I decided to check it out.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I read tons of reviews online, and decided on the MacBook Pro.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I could have gotten the MacBook for under $1000, but it did not have all the features I was looking for.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I really prefer the aluminum casing of the Pro to the white casing of the MacBook.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>And I didn't like the black pad on the bottom of the white casing.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The design is extremely aesthetically pleasing.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The unibody truly is a work of art.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's one piece, and for that reason seems more sturdy than other laptops I checked out.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Despite its sturdiness, it's very slim, and light.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I love the chicklit keys, and the keyboard is close to full size if not full size.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I've had no trouble typing on it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The keys also light up on the Pro, which I didn't think was a huge selling point, but now I really appreciate it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The battery life (close to 7 hours) is unbelievable.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Since the screen is compatible to my tv, I watch a lot of tv shows on it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>As I said, I have always used PCs, so I was worried about figuring out how Macs work.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Not that different than a PC, turns out.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I upgraded to a 4 GB hard drive, and I am very happy with the speed of my computer.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Some people have complained about Macs being slow, but I do not find that at all.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>All in all, I'm very pleased with my decision to get the MacBook Pro.</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>Well I must say I am very happy i did not buy apple's first iteration of the 13" aluminum macbook last year b/c they really got it right the second time around upgrading it to a macbook pro!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Its nice to have that "pro" stamp on a 13" now!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Apple has listened to their customers adding almost everything we have asked for and more, and managed to reduce the price!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Thanks Apple!.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>CHANGES FROM LAST YEAR.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>- $100 less.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>- 13" aluminum macbooks became macbook pros.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>- 2.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>53Ghz up from 2.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>4GHz dual core.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>- 4GB RAM up from 2GB.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>- led display has 60% greater color gamut than previous model.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>- new advanced built-in battery that lasts up to 7 hours vs 4hrs.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>- FireWire is back (after all the complaints of first model).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>- SD card slot (replaces express card slot).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>- new models now come with iLife '09.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>- separate digital audio input is gone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>- new model uses the same integrated mic and headphone port as the iPhone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>PROS.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>- finally a price cut with a performance upgrade!.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>i knew apple could do it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>i was tired of paying for aesthetics and not performance.??- new Snow Leopard Operating System comes pre-installed!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Same great ease of use with much faster performance!??- much better lcd screen!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>inline with the pro models...still glossy and still some glare but much nicer!??- backlight keyboard on all 13" models now!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>( i really enjoy this as it can be controlled from low to high)??- battery life is significantly better than last year.(</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>i get about 6 hours w/ regular use not the 7hrs that is reported)??- the computer is designed beautifully truly a head turner.??- iLife 09 suite is superb for pictures, movies, and music.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Good software really does sell hardware.??- SD card slot accepts SDHC, which goes up to 32GB and works like a charm.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>(can boot from SD card as well)??CONS??- aluminum outer casing does dent easily if dropped.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>(buy a soft case for it!)??- power cord is short and does not reach as many places as I would like...must sit very close to power outlet.??- battery can't be removed easily??- SD card sticks about half way out of slot.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>eye sore.??- blu-ray option would have been nice but understandable given licensing fees.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>(many blurays are offering digital copies which help)??Taking into consideration all the great improvements over last year with a nice price cut I can now truly recommend this near perfect Macbook Pro!??</sentcont></sentence>

<reviewtitle>Apple's lightest full-featured notebook</reviewtitle>
<rating>0.8</rating>
<freereview><sentence><sentcont>There are lots of positives.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>First, the aluminum unibody design is both gorgeous and practical.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The precision construction gives the whole unit a solid feel.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Aluminum and glass won't wear out like the plastic on many other laptops.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The silver matte finish with black keys looks classy as well.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Fingers glide easily over the large, glass trackpad.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The trackpad also operates as a mouse button -- it takes a small amount of pressure to click it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Other trackpads I've used often register a click just putting my fingers down -- the MacBook Pro's trackpad gives physical feedback which reduces those mis-clicks.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Multiple-finger gestures make it a snap to navigate through documents and websites.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Pressing with two fingers instead of one performs the equivalent of a right click.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Swiping with 2 fingers scrolls the current window.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Spreading fingers apart zooms in; pinching zooms out (similar to the iPhone).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Swiping 4 fingers exposes the desktop or switches between applications.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>These gestures are intuitive and it is hard going back to the Windows laptop after getting used to their convenience (I am really hooked on the 2-finger scrolling).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The keyboard automatically lights up as the room light dims.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This isn't an essential feature (especially for touch typists), but is helpful for picking out the correct function keys after dark.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's little touches like this that make the MacBook Pro a pleasure to use.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Apple put a lot of thought into the design of their power supply.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It has a special connector that attaches magnetically to main body -- so it connects easily and won't cause your laptop to crash to the floor if you trip over it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The connector even has a light that shows it's connected and charging (turning green when the battery reaches 100%).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>A little plastic clip on the cord helps manage its length.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>When traveling, the extension cord can be replaced with a retractable plug that goes directly into an outlet, so there's even less to carry.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The U.S. plug is included with the MacBook Pro, but you can order plugs for other countries.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The solid body, backlit keyboard and MagSafe power supply are nice design flourishes, but the important feature is the long battery life.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>??</sentcont></sentence>

<sentcont> Owned for nearly 2 months, purchased after upgrading from a 4yr old Apple iBook laptop</sentcont>
<sentcont>My work laptop is a HP 6530b with Vista</sentcont>
<sentcont>This laptop came bundled with Mac OS X Snow Leopard - very fast and much easier than any Windows operating system</sentcont>
<sentcont>Very good finish and battery life is very good</sentcont>
<sentcont>Even with heavy usage (backlit keyboard, bright screen, Skype over WiFi, bluetooth on etc) it lasts about 3 hours</sentcont>
<sentcont>For simple web browsing it can last 8 hours</sentcont>
<sentcont>Bought a clear Speck case for it which clips on and really adds to the attractive design while saving it from scratches</sentcont>
<sentcont>Overall better end product compared to the plasticky Windows alternatives</sentcont>
</sentence></pro>
<con><sentence>
<sentcont> Glossy screen is very reflective and shows marks easily</sentcont>
<sentcont>A bit heavy compared to white polycarbonate Macbook of same size, but it feels more sturdy for it</sentcont>

<sentcont> great graphics, Speedy navigation </sentcont>

<con><sentence>
<sentcont> price, too hot </sentcont>
</sentence></con>
<freereview><sentence><sentcont>Background: I've been a Windows/PC user for the last  15 years.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I never really seriously considered Macs, due to their price,  and perceived incompatibility with the most popular software.I</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>am an electrical engineer, so I can really appreciate the effort that Apple put into every aspect of the design.I've had this computer now for about two weeks.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I like it more each day.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>What made me finally "go Mac"?A  PC virus that my wife picked up from a Polish gossip website.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It got in  and jacked everything up pretty thoroughly.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I finally got the virus  off, but then Windows wouldn't restart.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I did a recovery, from a special  partition on my hard drive, which promised I would not lose data files,  but that I would lose all the latest applications I'd installed.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It  turned out to be BS.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I lost everything from the last 5 years, including  all my family photos.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>That hurt.As</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I sat there, reloading  everything, removing bloatware, and asking my friends and family to  email me any pictures they have, I thought to myself: "This is crap.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I  shouldn't have to do this, or even THINK about doing it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I'm getting a  Mac."So,</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I researched a bit online.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's sometimes hard to separate  Mac fanboy talk from truth.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Let's face it, Mac people can be pretty  obnoxious.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The place that has been the most helpful so far is  www.mac-forums.com.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>There is a forum there called 'Switchers'.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>A  switcher is what they call PC people who are finally opening their mind  and considering a Mac.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I asked a ton of questions on a thread called  'Mac: A good match for us?' Here's the  link:??http://www.mac-forums.com/forums/switcher-hangout/184691-mac-good-match-us.htmlSome  of those questions and answers may be helpful to you too.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>After reading  through those responses for a few days, I finally couldn't take it, and  had to pull the trigger.On</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>their advice, I bought a refurbished one  from Apple.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This model, the 13.3" Macbook Pro, with 2.26 GHz processor  and 160 GB hard drive, cost the same as the entry level Macbook.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Those  specs are the same.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But the Pro has the milled aluminum enclosure, which  looks nice, as well as a firewire jack and backlit keyboard.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The  backlit keyboard was the real seller for me.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I had gotten used to the  LED light that shone down on the keyboard of my work PC laptop.This</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>little feature is super-nice for those of us who don't like to stop  using the computer just because the sun went down or our spouses are  sleeping next to us.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It is also variable intensity, so it can be just  barely on, or blaring away.The</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>function keys are set by default to  control important things on the computer: screen brightness, keyboard  backlight brightness, volume, iTunes controls, dashboard controls,  Superdrive eject, and application viewer.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>(Superdrive is Apple's name  for DVD writer)It took some getting used to, the fact that Macs have 'command', 'option', and 'control' instead of 'Control' and 'Alt'The  keyboard has flat keys instead of concave "Chiclet-style" keys like  PCs.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This seems like a wash.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I don't really prefer one over the other.The  screen is glossy instead of matte.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>For those of you who like to point  to the screen and touch it, this will be a disappointment.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But maybe it  will teach you to either use the cursor or to "hover" instead of  touching!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I agree with Apple, that the screen appears clearer because of  this high gloss finish.The</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>packaging was very nice, and my Macbook  was shipped in two days by FedEx.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I can't tell it from new.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>There are no  scratches anywhere, and everything works perfectly.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It also has the  same warranty as a new Mac.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Good enough for me, when I'm saving $200!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Of  course the same instructions and hardware are included as well.This</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Macbook is thinner than an equivalent PC laptop, and with every edge  rounded.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Careful not to drop it!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This is not even the 'Air' version of  the Macbook either.The</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>touchpad is at least 3X bigger than any PC's  touchpad.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This, on its own, makes it much more easy to use and precise.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Add to this the fact that it has a matte glass surface and the whole pad  is a big click button and it is much better than a PCs.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Not only that,  but it is programmed so that it is actually as quick to use as a scroll  mouse.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>For example, swiping two fingers at a time causes the screen to  scroll, rather than just moving the cursor.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Swiping three fingers left  or right jumps back or ahead (respectively) a page.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Swiping four fingers  down shrinks each application so all open applications show on the  screen.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>To select a different one, just click on it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Swiping four  fingers up minimizes all applications off the screen.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Moving two fingers  apart zooms in, and pinching them together zooms out.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Rotating them  rotates images.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This seems like a lot to remember at first, but I found  that I learned it in about two days by heart, and I don't even miss a  mouse any more.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>(I always bring a mouse with my PC laptop for work  >:(The program (Apple calls them 'applications') package is also  very nice.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The Safari web browser is much faster than IE and a little  faster than Firefox.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The Top Sites feature is really neat; it remembers  the top 10 sites that I visit, and keeps them handy.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I find that I use  this more than I use the Favorites list.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Everything about it is just  smooth, and I haven't yet found a website that didn't look right or run  properly on it.Finder is the equivalent to Windows Explorer.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But  again, it is more well thought-out.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Things are easy to figure out.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The  default ways are much more rational than Windows Explorer.The mail program looks pretty slick, but I used web-based mail and choose not to use it.I  like that it comes with a nice chess program instead of a bunch of  crappy third party game demos.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>(I admit that I do miss solitaire from  time to time)iTunes is of course brilliant.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I liked it on PC, and I like it on Mac too.iPhoto  is OK for family picture type stuff.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It is geared more towards that and  helping one keep one's photos organized.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If you are a serious amateur  photographer, you'll probably want to buy another photo program.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I'm  using a demo of Pixelmator now, and I really like it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It will cost $60  to register when the demo runs out, but I think I'll do it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This is an  example of not as much freeware available for Mac as for PC.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I found  Irfanview for PC, which was fast, simple, and free.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I loved it and used  it for years.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I finally paid the $25 to register it and support Mr.  Irfan Skiljan.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>When I came to Mac, it didn't seem like there's an  equivalent freeware photo editing program.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The stuff that IS available  is as good or better than what is available for Windows, but it is just  not free.I have an old copy of MS Office that I'd been installing on  my PCs for years.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I'll need to go out and buy a copy for Mac.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>There is  OpenOffice and Neo Office available for free for Mac, but they can be  glitchy, I've read.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>(read NeoOffice's disclaimers about crashing; pretty  scary, considering they just asked for a donation)iChat is  brilliant.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It uses the Macbook Pro's built-in webcam.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The picture  quality is better than any PC webcam I've seen.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The video quality was  also better.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Not only that, but there don't seem to be any security  risks like there is for Skype for Windows.The Preview program is  really good too.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Basically, it allows you to see a useful preview of  images and popular other types of files (documents, PDFs, etc.) without  having to open another application.Other</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>deails that really impressed the engineer side of me:- The cooling fan is quiet, and is a blower style instead of a conventional fan style.-</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The power plug is magnetic.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It goes on and off easily and won't pull the computer on the floor if it is tripped over.-</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The headphone jack doubles as a microphone jack.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Just change it's function in a menu.-</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It has a built-in SD memory card slow.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>No messing around trying to find  the USB cable for your digital camera.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Just put the card in the Mac and  you're good to go.-</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The Superdrive doesn't use a tray.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Just put the  disc in the side.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The mechanism that takes the disc is much louder than  a tray type though.-</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>There are no dedicated ventilation openings.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The Macbook uses the opening for the monitor hinge for this.-</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>There are no dedicated openings for speakers.</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>Pros:  -The aluminum body feels solid -The keyboard feels right and is backlit -The LED Screen is just superb.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Some people complain about this but to me, it is just bright, clear and colors are outstanding.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>-Battery life averaging at most 5 hours.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Not bad but nowhere near  the 7 hours advertised.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Not a con bc the battery life is still excellent -Bootup speed is superb.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>20 seconds to boot up and less than 5 seconds to shut it down.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>-Snow Leopard is fast and expose makes life easier.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>cons: -First of all, this is the bottom of the line macbook pro.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If you  wanna do any serious "professional" work here, you won't be happy.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>9400M  graphics card is mediocre.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>-Snow Leopard is far from being stable.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Plenty of compatibility issues, especially with Adobe products.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>-Safari is a memory hog -Heating issues.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Aliminum dissipates heat better, so I wonder how those white macbooks handle the heat issue.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>-Why on earth would the team design for the macbook pro line-up  design a vent dissipating heat towards the screen.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>That WILL cause the  premature failure.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>-USB ports are TOo CLOSE TOGETHER.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If you use a non-bluetooth  mouse(which is recommended for a longer battery life) and want to use a  flashdrive, you have to choose for one or the other.</sentcont></sentence>

<sentence><sentcont>Really Apple?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It doesn't even support audio at  the moment so why replace the mini-dvi display?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Or why not go the HDMI  option?</sentcont></sentence>

<reviewtitle>2.26GHz 13 Macbook Pro: Worth the price.</reviewtitle>
<rating>0.8</rating>
<pro><sentence>
<sentcont> Lightweight, slick and simple, easy to use</sentcont>
</sentence></pro>
<con><sentence>
<sentcont> Compatibility with programs (though that IS getting better), can't run programs or download while laptop is closed</sentcont>
</sentence></con>
<freereview><sentence><sentcont>I originally owned a 13" 2.16 black Macbook and for almost two years and it served me well.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I'm an Integrated Marketing & Communications student (which is just a fancy name for mixed media advertising) and our course requires us to work in a Maclab to use the various applications essential for creating rich media (e.g. Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator, GarageBand, iDVD, iMovie, Final Cut Express, Word, etc.) Macbook (Pro) is apparently the "industry standard" for media types so it was only fitting that I buy one.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>When it came time to purchase, like a good student, I did my homework and found that although Macbook is a great computer, it is more expensive than its Windows based peers.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It was actually kind of annoying.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I could get the same power as a Macbook for half the price.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Why would I want to buy a Macbook? 3 reasons:1) That is what I'm learning on.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Use an Apple (iMac) at school, might as well use a  Apple Macbook at home.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>2) That is what the big-wheels use and is the "industry standard".</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>My teachers kept reminding us that when it comes to working with photography, video and  media, Apple was the way to.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Take a look around the Internet and look at what many of the pro's are using.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>They use Macbook Pro's!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Big surprise.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>3) Individuality.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Now, several of my classmates also felt they needed to buy a Macbook for the first 2 reasons and they did.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So I made sure to buy the black Macbook which performed a little better and had a Superdrive, meaning I  finished burning my videos quicker then my classmates using the iMac's DVD burner!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So although a dozen people in my class also had a Macbook, we were  still a minority on campus, which to me, is great because when it comes to  being a business student, it's nice to stand out from all the other suits.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So! What about the new 13" Macbook Pro?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>All we've heard are stories about this old black Macbook.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Who cares?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Patience, good reviewees, it has relevance.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>When it came time to actually purchase the laptop it was tough because I was living off of student loans and buying a laptop was going to take a chunk of my budget.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I looked around for used and found an older 15" Macbook Pro for a decent price.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>However it was an older processor (Intel Core Duo, which had a tendency to get hot) and the coating from the keyboard edge had flaked off.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Despite these minor shortcomings I was very close to buying it because it had the "Pro" status and the seller, sensing my hesitation, was even going to throw in a 500 MB external drive to sweeten the deal!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>At the end of the day, after much deliberation I made the decision to buy the new 13" black Macbook.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It cost a little more then the used Macbook Pro but it had the new Intel Core 2 Duo and wasn't very far off the performance of the older Pro model.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>For just over a year and a half, that black Macbook served me well.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>After a few hardware problems that seemed to just be a result of a "bad Apple", I was given a replacement.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Luckily, for me, that occurred on June 5th, 2009 - the day the new Macbook Pro's came out.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Because my black Macbook was more expensive and powerful then the white ones, I was given the brand new 13" 2.26GHz Macbook Pro which is comparitive in price and overall specs e.g. same size screen and 160 GB hard drive but has an extra GB of RAM, the SD card slot, aluminum unibody, glass screen, Nvidia GeForce 9400M graphics, etc.So I've walked that fine line between the high end Macbook and the low end Macbook Pro.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I was a little sorry to see my old black Macbook go.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>As I said earlier and despite its hardware issues, it served me well.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Call me sentimental.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Despite the obvious upgrade I was a little hesitant about the new Macbook Pro.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Will I like the aluminum look?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The glossy screen?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>(as opposed to the matte screen on my black Macbook), the closed battery concept, the keyboard...Well here it is.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I have been using computers since the Vic-20 (yes I'm 32 years old).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I have used Microsoft products for a long time (Dos shell anyone?).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>After many years of happily using Windows on various desktops, I was willing to try something new.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>My old black Macbook and subsequently my current Macbook Pro with Leopard OS is amazing.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>My brother, who is a die-hard PC user and lover of Windows still looks at my computer with envy (if not a little fear, which is the biggest reason most people don't switch to a Mac, they don't know the Leopard experience).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>When my brother uses my laptop, he loves it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The chiclet, backlit keyboard, the vibrant colours of my glossy screen, its loading speed and the sheer beauty of the aluminum body.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>My black Macbook chipped on the right side of the trackpad near the edge just from resting my hand on it and I noticed (because I looked) on my classmates Macbooks that this wasn't an isolated incident.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>All in all, the new Macbook Pro is a work of art that performs, like a Porsche or Mercedes.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It has amazing resale value and every good thing said about it is 100% true.</sentcont></sentence>

<sentcont> cant think of any..</sentcont>
</sentence></con>
<freereview><sentence><sentcont>Ok, starting out, this is my first Mac.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I have wanted one since freshman year of college (2006).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>My first college computer was a 15 inch Dell inspiron clunker that got almost no battery life and was slow and huge, and well, a PC.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I never realized how annoying PC's were until using Macs, and finally found the time, money, and model combination that fit me.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I bought my Macbook Pro 13 inch aluminum unibody model in late july.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It has the baseline specs as I saw no need for a larger hard drive when I have an external already and 2.25 ghz is almost twice the speed of my dell.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The operating system was familiar to me through playing with my friends' macs every chance i got.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>After playing with this baby for 4 days, I am hooked...here's my initial comments :D~THe backlit keyboard is so awesome and comes in much handier than you think.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It makes it so easy to see in the dark, and the ambient light sensor turns it on/off, but the amount of light is adjustable with the F5 and F6 keys.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>~The design is absolutely gorgeous.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I initially liked the all aluminum design of the previous generation MBP but i like the feel of the non aluminum keys better and the black accents look sharp.~The glossy screen is not as bad as some people make it out to be.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The glass looks really sharp if you keep it clean, but it does get smudgy easily, so don't touch the screen if you can avoid it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>~The light sensor also adjusts the screen brightness to lower levels in lower light (also manually adjustable with the F1 and F2 keys, but this is one less thing you have to worry about and also helps save battery life)~Speaking of battery life, this thing is phenomenal.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Apple boasts 7 hours of battery life on a charge, but as I sit here typing this review with iChat, Entourage, iTunes, and 3 Safari windows going, the battery meter in my menu bar shows 7:59 after I have already been working on battery for about 30 minutes.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>My old Dell got 2.5 hours on a good day with no wireless on and only typing notes in class.~Some</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>people stressed concerns about the aluminum getting warm under heavy use.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I used this machine on battery for about 3-4 hours this morning on my lap with shorts on and noticed no detectable heat at all, let alone burning hot aluminum.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This machine keeps its cool under a lot of pressure :D~The new glass trackpad is a breeze to use.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Older Macbook users may or may not like the removal of the button at the bottom.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The bottom of the trackpad physically clicks down (the middle somewhat, no movement near the top) and the entire thing clicks with the tap of a finger much like PC's if you select this option.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Finger swipe options are incredibly accurate and so handy.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Two fingers scrolls up and down, side to side.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Three fingers swipes pages and photos, etc. side to side. 4 fingers up or down activates expose and to the side switches between applications that are open but may not be showing.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Hot corners can also be assigned in System Preferences.~Some people may find that the edge of the notebook is a smidge "sharp" compared to older models for the sake of aesthetics.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I have small hands so this is not an issue with me as the edge sits halfway down my forearm, but for some with larger hands, this may sit uncomfortably at the wrist joint.~Microsoft</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Office 2008 does not come standard, but a trial version can be downloaded for 30 days with no obligation to buy at the official product site.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I found this software easy to use and Outlook users will find the switch to Entourage easy and pleasant.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>My Day is a desktop staple that acts as a mini Palm Pilot and is very useful.~No</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>bloatware comes on Macs!! I uninstalled NOTHING on this machine and have not even had enough time to learn how to play with GarageBand and iMovie.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Also, the Apple site has thousands of Freeware and Shareware programs under "downloads" that make your Mac your own.~Dashboard is so much fun and keeps your desktop clear of all the widgets which Google Desktop and Vista cram into one sidebar.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Again, thousands of widgets available with more added every day.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Pops open upon a click or a press of F4.~All the function keys work without any of the applications clicked.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I can have iTunes skip a song when the screen is nowhere in sight and Expose can be popped up anytime via F3 or 4 finger swipe up.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>~Mac OS is such a breeze to use.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's pretty, fun to use and very intuitive.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Things go where you think they should be and if they aren't, search for it in Spotlight.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Time Machine i have yet to set up but is an awesome feature and is more useful in case you delete something more so than if the Mac crashes since Macs rarely crash (no viruses or virus scans!!)~All in all, this is worth the upgrade from the Macbook.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's beautiful, it works hard and plays hard and seems like a hefty price tag if you are coming from the discount PC world where you get what you pay for if you buy a $400 model.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This functions as a desktop replacement computer with a thin and light chassis.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I will never go back to PC:D~</sentcont></sentence>

<reviewtitle>Adds SD card slot and reacquires FireWire; lower starting price</reviewtitle>
<rating>0.8</rating>
<freereview><sentence><sentcont>Most notable, the 13-inch aluminum unibody MacBook has been promoted to join the MacBook Pro family.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's a move that makes sense, as the differences between the two lines were becoming increasingly blurred.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>To complete the transformation, the 13-inch Pro regains its missing FireWire port, making it even more useful for creative professionals on the go.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>New to the Pro line is something we never thought we'd see on a MacBook: an SD card slot.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Standard on the 13- and 15-inch Pro laptops, this corrects one of our main MacBook annoyances.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>We're also pleased to see the backlit keyboard--previously found in only the more expensive 13-inch versions--filter down to even the $1,149 base model (which is a nice discount from the previous $1,299 entry price).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Some have strong feelings about the nonremovable battery--similar to those already found on the MacBook Air and 17-inch Pro.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's a legitimate concern, but we think the promise of better battery life (Apple claims up to a 40 percent improvement), and three times as many recharge cycles as older batteries is just as important.</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>MacBook Pro is awesome.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I mean, I use it all the time, and see nothing that is wrong.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Maybe it is because of the price, but I don't really know.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I honestly don't care much, I just want the Gaia Cash to goes along with this, sorry!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But I can say MacBooks are light, reliable and pretty easy to use.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I never seen a flaw in it before, and It is so cool.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I can currently at the halfway point of nine hundred characters.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>MacBook Pro is nice in graphics and stuff.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I once took a video of my dog, posted into iMovie, and I had wonderful efecgts added into it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It was very nice.</sentcont></sentence>

<sentence><sentcont>There are cons as well.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>A con is that it is very expensive.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>You buy the laptop, a bag, extra batteries and such and you will be paying twice the amoung of the laptop.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It is almost ridiculous.</sentcont></sentence>

<sentence><sentcont>It has plenty of power for running demanding applications in the background while you work on other tasks.</sentcont></sentence>

<sentence><sentcont>Apple uses all free programms that Google provides for us, and at the same time Apple doesn't share their own products with Google.</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>At first glance, you may not notice anything different about Apple???s latest line of MacBook Pros, introduced in April 2010.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The new models, which feature 13-, 15- and 17-inch screens, sport the same sleek, minimalist design, the same keyboard, and the same touch pad as the previous iteration.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Even the ports haven???t changed.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>To tell the difference, you really have to get down and dirty and actually start using one of these new members of the MacBook Pro family.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Once you do, you.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>?ll see advancements in performance in a line of laptops that was already well ahead of much of its market, and battery life that blows the competition out of the park.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>We got our hands on an entry-level $1,199 MacBook Pro, built around a 2.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>4GHz Intel Core 2 Duo processor, a 250GB hard drive, and a 13-inch screen.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This is the base model of the group.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>For $200 more, you can bump up your processor to 2.66GHz and your hard drive to 320GB.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The 15-inch models start at $1,799, and the 17-inchers at $2,199.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The 15-inch and 17-inch models now come standard with Core i5 processors (you can upgrade to Core i7) and advanced switchable graphics technology.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The 13-inch offers only Core 2 Duo CPUs and integrated Nvidia GeForce 320M graphics in both its models.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Take note: With this generation of MacBook Pros, the base price of the 15-inch model has increased by $100; the 17-inch base price has decreased by $200; and the 13-inch base price stays the same.On the outside, the 13-inch MacBook Pro is almost exactly the same as the previous version.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Design-wise, we think Apple was smart to approach the new line with the attitude that if it???s not broken, don???t fix it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The previous line of MacBook Pros was as stunning as it was stark, and the new line carries that torch onward.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The silver case, dominated by an aluminum shell with just one seam around the underside, feels plenty solid.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Nothing much mars the design of the MacBook???s body: On the top of the lid is a simple white Apple logo that lights up when the laptop is in use.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>And, well, that???s about it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The case snaps shut with a magnetic latch, making opening the lid easy without compromising the durability of the body.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Like the previous version, the ports are located on the left side of the chassis and include an Ethernet jack, a FireWire 800 port (backward-compatible with FireWire 400, 200, and 100), a mini-DisplayPort connector (for attaching an external display), two USB 2.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>0 ports, an SD-card slot, and a headphone jack.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Toward the front left of the chassis are indicator lights that allow for a quick look at remaining battery power.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>On the right side of the body are a security-lock slot and the opening for the slot-loading optical drive, which is a dual-layer DVD burner.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>As with previous MacBook lines, it doesn???t support Blu-ray discs.Once</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>you open the lid, you???ll also notice that little has changed in the design of the keyboard and touch pad (which Apple terms its "trackpad").</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The full-size keyboard comes with backlit keys, and it remains perfectly spaced and nicely responsive to the touch.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>An ambient-light sensor adjusts the key backlighting according to the brightness of the area where you???re working.On the keyboard deck is the generously sized, buttonless multi-touch trackpad, which has a glass surface.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Instead of the two-button pad you???ll find on most other laptops, the entire pad on the MacBook Pro acts as a button, allowing you to press anywhere to enact a function; you use two fingers to right-click.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>One new feature related to it is that if you swipe up or down on the pad with two fingers, you???ll continue to scroll through the page until it reaches the top or bottom, just as an iPad or iPhone works.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>We appreciate these touches that Apple keeps adding to further bridge its products together.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>We also discovered that you can even toggle in and out of full-screen mode when watching a DVD by pinching and pulling on the touch pad, a nice enhancement.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>We found the trackpad very easy to get used to, especially since it functions much like the touch screen on an iPad or iPhone.As with previous MacBook Pros, the pad also allows you to use a four-finger swipe to show your desktop, view all open windows, or change programs.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Of course, the now-requisite multi-touch functionality is built in here as well.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>(This is the same as the touch features on an Apple iPhone or iPad, allowing you to zoom, rotate, and slide images around with two fingers.)The</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>13-inch glossy screen on the model we tested has a native resolution of 1,280x800 and is not upgradable.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Graphic designers who require a higher-resolution screen might want to look at upgrading to the 17-inch model, which comes standard with a resolution of 1,920x1,200.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>We found the 13-inch base model???s screen displays movies and photos with vivid, accurate colors.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Artists also take note: Although the option of an antiglare screen is available in the 15- and 17-inch models, it's not offered for the 13-inch screen.If</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>you bought the previous version of the 13-inch MacBook Pro and are happy with what you have, we say stick with it, as this round has seen only minor changes for this screen size.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If you're looking to go to a larger model, however, huge improvements in CPU and graphics performance in the 15- and 17-inch models make them attractive upgrade options, so long as you're willing to pay a premium for them.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If you didn't upgrade last time, however, the latest iteration of the 13-inch MacBook Pro is solidly ahead of the laptop pack in both design and performance, and it comes at an affordable price, for a MacBook.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>We applaud the unprecedented battery life in the new line of MacBook Pros.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Apple has once again taken what was already an impressive machine and made it even better.</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>?? Although the MacBook and MacBook Pro line was initially relaunched last fall with the 17-inch version intact, it was recently revamped to sport the same sleek, unibody construction as its 13- and 15-inch siblings.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Although it shares their design and the 15-inch Pro's switchable?? it's different in two key ways: its nonremovable battery promises up to 8 hours on a charge, and its display has a 60 percent increase in the 15-inch Pro's color gamut.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's also the thinnest and lightest 17-inch laptop on the planet.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Starting at a hefty $2,799, the 17-inch MacBook Pro is not for everyone, but for creative professionals who can afford it, this machine is close to perfect.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Lightweight Design If you're inclined to avoid a 17-inch notebook because you think it will be less portable than a notebook with a smaller screen, think again.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>At 6.6 pounds and 0.98 inches thick, the 17-inch MacBook Pro is the world's thinnest and lightest notebook with that size display.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In fact, this system is only slightly heavier than the typical 15.4-inch laptop, and plenty of 16-inch models weigh more.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>??The unibody chassis is cut from a single piece of metal; you won't find any seams or doors, not even for the battery.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In addition to making for an eye-catching design, the unibody construction enhances the notebook's durability.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Rather than a latch enclosure, the lid keeps shut with an internal magnet.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The notebook felt sturdy as we carried it from room to room.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Keyboard Before the recent redesign, the old 17-inch MacBook Pro had a keyboard layout that felt larger than the 15-inch version's; a bigger footprint meant bigger keys.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>For some, the 17-inch model's keys were, in fact, too large.??</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The latest MacBook Pros have island keyboards, whose low-profile, Chiclet keys sit in the center of the keyboard deck, flanked by diminutive speaker strips.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Like the other recently announced MacBooks, these take after the original?? contrasting black keys against an aluminum body.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>While the keys themselves seem the same size, you might find yourself craning over a wider palm rest.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>As an added touch, the keyboard is backlit in low light, thanks to an ambient light sensor.</sentcont></sentence>

<sentence><sentcont>Tonight I upgrade the RAM to 4 GByte, and the HD to 320 GByte (rather do it myself, save some money, and have an extra HD).</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>As a student, Writer and avid music listener, I spend lots of time on the go and on my computer.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So when my Dell Inspiron 1525 died(which i hated btw), I decided to spend the money for a better laptop.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>My first choice was the regular MacBook but my cousin who has had 2 MacBooks, suggested the MacBook Pro.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Well working part-time, it took me about a month to save up but man was it worth it!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I purchased mine refurbished through the Apple Store, which I highly recommend.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Two days later my MacBook Pro 13" laptop arrived.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It comes in a non-chalant brown box, but once opened reveals a small black box with the MacBook Pro on the front.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Opening the box was like your first time in love, a very giddy moment for me.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Opening it reveals the basic items in any laptop, the charger/cords/software/cleaning cloth, oh I almost forgot about the actual MacBook which is wrapped in a black cloth, very simple yet elegant.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Turning it on and plugging it in was easy and after a bright and musical opening screen, a number of screens show up asking for your basic info.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>and asking for a MobileMe account, which is optional.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Once started up, everything ran flawlessly and all programs ran smoothly from the moment I turned it on, no lag whatsoever.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>After downloading all my favorite programs and changing the Background of course I was not disappointed at all.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I didn't run any tests on performance except for startup and shutdown tests.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Mine starts up in under 10 seconds and shuts down in just over 5 seconds.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Much better than the almost 2 minutes for my old Dell computer.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Unlike Windows computers, when the desktop shows up, you can get right to work with no delay and nothing pops up unless you allow it to.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>My personal favorite things have to be the 7 hour battery life(which I tested) and the Itunes integrated keys.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The battery under normal usage lasts me between 5 1/2 hours and up to 7 hours, much better than 2 hours out of my Dell.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Most people would say they love the lightweight or backlit keys best, but personally, as a multi-tasker and music listener, I love the Itunes integrated keys.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Pressing play automatically opens Itunes if it's not up and no matter if Itunes is minimized or not, your music will pause or play.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The Dashboard key is also a nice touch, allowing you to access apps like a calendar or Facebook without interrupting your work.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>There really no cons about the computer except the screen attracts dust like a magnet and smugges are surprisingly hard to get off even with the cloth they supply.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>For travelers, students, writers, or anyone that uses their computer a lot or just wants a long-lasting computer I highly recommend the MacBook Pro 13".</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>This computer is absolutely wonderful.First of all, I customized mine with 4 GB RAM and iWork preinstalled.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Other than that it's still the base 2.26 GHz 13".The speed of this computer is amazing.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I can click on the Safari icon and in half a second I have my homepage loaded.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The 2.26 GHz Core 2 Duo really performs better than I would've expected, coming from PCs.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This really comes in handy when unzipping files and doing more intensive work such as video editing.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I ordered 4 GB of RAM from Apple, and even with about 15 windows open this thing runs like a champ.The trackpad is simply amazing.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The multitouch gestures are very useful and intuitive.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I also really like the size and feel of the trackpad compared to my old HP.The keyboard is very comfortable to use.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The backlight not only is useful at night but also adds to the computer's appearance.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The screen is bright and beautiful.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It doesn't get as much glare as others have said.The</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>aluminum unibody enclosure is an awesome addition.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The aluminum feels sturdy and looks good; not to mention the fact that the enclosure is very smooth and cool to the touch, much more than what I can say about my HP. iLife is excellent.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I can't believe it was free; what MS has to offer for free is absolute junk compared to this stuff.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>iPhoto and iMovie are very user friendly and GarageBand has been helping me with my guitar.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>PhotoBooth is a good app for a little fun.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>iWork is also very good, though I think I prefer the MS Office way of doing things.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>At least it's much better than what OpenOffice and Google have to offer.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The battery life is incredible.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I'm getting about six hours rather than the advertised seven, but that's still amazing considering the power of this machine.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Mac OS X is undoubtedly the best operating system ever created.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Fast, user friendly, many possibilities, and... well, it just works.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>My only problem with this computer is Mac OS X's spinning pinwheel of death.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I've gotten it three times so far, and I've only had this computer one day.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Two times it disappeared in a fraction of a second and caused no harm, but one time it completely froze my system and I had to shut down by holding down the power button.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>After rebooting, though, (which only took 25 seconds on OS X), all was well again.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I highly recommend this computer to anyone who is either sick of PCs or is a long-time Mac user looking for a new, powerful, yet portable, notebook.</sentcont></sentence>

<sentcont> Beautiful unibody construction, good backlit keyboard, light weight, fast, stylish design, excellent support </sentcont>
</sentence></pro>
<con><sentence>
<sentcont> Very high price tag, lacking in features found in similarly priced laptops including firewire 400, expresscard slot, incompatible with a lot of hardware, proprietary OS, annoying trackpad, no matte screen option</sentcont>
<sentcont>no bluray option</sentcont>
</sentence></con>
<freereview><sentence><sentcont>The new 13 inch Macbook Pro is a great improvement over the previous generation 13 inch Macbook Pro but is still vastly inferrior to it's similarly priced PC counterparts.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It is very sexy and stylish and is running the proprietary Macintosh OS which some may consider an upside and others will consider a downside.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The upside being that if you've been frustrated with Windows Vista but don't want an antiquated PC running XP(but more importantly, you didn't like XP) then this may be a great option for you.If however style is not as important as function and you've enjoyed using XP or like Vista then a similarly priced ThinkPad will provide you with a better experience having better performance, better build quality and more features for about the same price from a company rated to have support almost as good as Apple's (Consumer reports rates Apple #1 in customer support, Lenovo #2).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Consider checking out the Lenovo T400 ThinkPad.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Play with both, talk to a sales rep about life expectancy of the battery and the machine it's self.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Do not go to an Apple Store.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Try to find a local shop that sells both types of computers or at least a non-big box retailer that is both an Apple Specialist and an IBM business partner.</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>The good: Adds SD card slot and reacquires FireWire; lower starting price; same solid unibody construction and giant multitouch trackpad.</sentcont></sentence>

<sentence><sentcont>Expand full review Radically overhauled last year, Apple's MacBook line of laptops moved to aluminum construction, edge-to-edge glass over LED displays, and oversize multitouch trackpads (with the exception of the lone $999 white plastic model).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The latest round of updates is more of a refinement than another revolution, but it adds some much-sought-after features, while lowering prices on many configurations.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Most notable, the 13-inch aluminum unibody MacBook has been promoted to join the MacBook Pro family.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's a move that makes sense, as the differences between the two lines were becoming increasingly blurred.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>To complete the transformation, the 13-inch Pro regains its missing FireWire port, making it even more useful for creative professionals on the go.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>New to the Pro line is something we never thought we'd see on a MacBook: an SD card slot.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Standard on the 13- and 15-inch Pro laptops, this corrects one of our main MacBook annoyances.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>We're also pleased to see the backlit keyboard--previously found in only the more expensive 13-inch versions--filter down to even the $1,149 base model (which is a nice discount from the previous $1,299 entry price).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Some have strong feelings about the nonremovable battery--similar to those already found on the MacBook Air and 17-inch Pro.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's a legitimate concern, but we think the promise of better battery life (Apple claims up to a 40 percent improvement), and three times as many recharge cycles as older batteries is just as important.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>There are still a few items on our 13-inch wish list--matte screens, mobile broadband options, Blu-ray--but Apple has done an admirable job filling in some of the major missing pieces.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>By offering more features for less money, the 13-inch MacBook Pro remains one of the most universally useful laptops available.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The design and construction of the system remain largely the same as last year's model, with a solid block of aluminum carved down, rather than a thin outer shell that has had support struts added to it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's both lighter and sturdier than the older plastic versions of the 13-inch MacBook.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The new Pro also retains the same oversize trackpad, where the entire surface depresses like a button--although a simple tapping (as on a PC laptop) will also work once you turn that option on in the settings menu.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>We've become accustomed to the two-, three-, and four-finger multitouch gestures, which let you hide all your apps by sweeping four fingers up on the pad, or bring up the application switcher by sweeping four fingers left or right.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Once you get used to that, going back to a regular touch pad is difficult.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>According to Apple, the new display offers a wider color gamut, and the screen certainly looks bright and colorful, but we wish the same matte-screen option offered on the 17-inch MacBook Pro was available across the line.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The 13.3-inch wide-screen LCD offers a 1,280x800-pixel native resolution, which is standard for screens this size, but we'd love to see Apple try its hand at a 16:9 laptop display.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>While the LED screen means a thinner lid and some battery life benefits, the edge-to-edge glass covering the entire display panel grabs stray light rays with ease, making the glossy screen hard to see in some lighting conditions.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>By bringing back the FireWire port (now FireWire 800) and adding an SD card slot, Apple has addressed most of our most pressing issues with the previous 13-inch model.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Pro photographers will point out that they usually use CompactFlash cards, but the rest of us won't have to always remember to pack a USB card reader or cable to directly connect our cameras.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Connecting to another video display, however, will require a sold-separately dongle for the Mini-DisplayPort video output.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The 13-inch MacBook Pro performed as expected in our benchmark tests, with the 2.26GHz GHz Intel Core 2 Duo CPU roughly on par with the 2.4GHz processor in the late-2008 version of the 13-inch MacBook.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Trading up to the faster 2.8GHz Core 2 Duo available in the 15-inch MacBook Pro yields a marked improvement on paper, but for most anecdotal use--Web surfing, working on office documents, multimedia playback--any of the current MacBooks will be more than adequate.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>An even faster 3.08GHz CPU is available on the 15-inch MacBook Pro, but the 13-inch model tops out at 2.53GHz.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The fact is this review is useless, all the reviews a pretty much  useless, because only two types of people read them, mac users or soon  to be mac users that want a new computer are looking for a excuse to buy  one, or windows users that feel for what ever reason apple has no  business makeing things and this some how hurts them, and the only way  to heal such a pain is with fire, flamebait filled fire.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>All in all my  word don't mean much, but if think you'll enjoy owning and using the  computer, then go ahead and get one, there nice machines that run well  and are extremely well built, but i won't lie to you and tell you that  there cheap, there not, and i won't tell you that your getting hardware  you can't get from another company, because you can, but when it all  boils down to it, the whole is more then the sum of its parts and by  purchasing a mac, your getting an experience you can't get else where  and in my opinion no dell or hp will match it.</sentcont></sentence>
