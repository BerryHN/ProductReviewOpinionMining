<sentence><sentcont>Media player hard to manage, it can play video, but is all N95 owner know how to put video in it?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>And the GPS, I bet most of the N95 owner buy the unlocked one and the map that pre installed not they home country,and did you even have the GPRS service?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Otherwise you cannot use the GPS, and I did try it.. the map interface so slow.. I even find my way my self, before the map finish loading.</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>sorry guys ,but you are comparing the N95 to the HTC and you really are not fair.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>just comparing symbian (N95) to windows mobile  5.0 0r 6.0 (HTC, I-mate, ASUS,....) is not fair, because windows mobile is by far more important, applicable ,and above all stable.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>no, it is not true that symbian does not lock or freez, the true is that symbian is the worst oparating system as far as stability is concern.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>moreover, symbian compared to mobile windows is complicated for simple casual users, while windows ....even a 5 year old boy can work on it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>so, please be objective and stop praising the symbian machines because someday nokia will shift into windows.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>finally let me tell you the N95 cons    1- very low battery life.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>2- 5 mega picture with NO natural colors.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>3- the GPS is SIRF II not SIRF III this means that sensitivity is low.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>4- the GPS can not work with other than the build in applications.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>5- it freezes 2-3 times per day and you need to remove the battery to restart it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>6- the restart takes about 1-3 minutes.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>7- very slow menu navigation.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>8- No handwriting screens  9- no keyboard  10- no jogdial.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>so guys the only innovation in this phone is a big screen, and even it is not that big.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>so pray that the nokia engineer will reach a day to update the n95 firmware to solve these issues.</sentcont></sentence>

</sentence></con>
<freereview><sentence><sentcont>I have bought this phone several months ago, without a contract.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I didn't want a generic IPhone, because apple products are substandard because apple employs a premium pricing strategy for their products so people to buy their stuff thinking that it's better because it's more expensive.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Nokia one the other hand makes high quality products, which pick up a signal when all other brands show no bars.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The n95 specifically has very attractive features including internal gps which doesn't rely on the network and works very well with garmin mobile, and wifi which allows you to use the internet for free in most urban areas.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>You can also sign up for the cheapest data plan, and still access the net at 3g speeds, for things like listening to streaming internet radio and watching video anywhere without the really expensive pda data plans.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It is very durable and stylish albeit a bit bulky, and is sure to stand out in a crowd of iphones and motorollas.</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>I work for the carphone warehouse, we launched it today, so don't wait around till the 9th of April for o2 direct when we are doing the same deals!!!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It is in high demand and is more likely to be in stores than on the website which has it as *out of stock*.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>A few things to note.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Don't know what that previous review was on about, the screen size and coloure is far supirior to that of the N80, and i owned the N80, which i couldn't get rid of quick enough, was the worst most expensive phone i have had, and in my opinion, and i tell my customers this, the N-series is awfull, slow and full of bugs!.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Nokia have been well aware of this with terrible sales and targets not met.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So we were worried about the N95, as with all the N-series, they look great on paper but in reality they have to much on them and not enough juice or proper software to cope with it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I am really happy to say that the N95 is by far the best phone nokia have produced, we got ours 5 days ago, but due to Nokia launch date we weren't aloud to sell them, so we've had a good play with them.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>First thing first,    *Be aware that the GPS is very smart, graphics are quick and easy and does not suffer from time delay as we thought it may, take note though that it is not a TOM TOM and your network provider will charge you for data connections using this service.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>How ever if u went for a company like t-mobile then the web and walk will more than pay for it's self, especially when using the integrated web browser!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Which by the way is very smart and was my favourite feature of the N80 (they have made it easier to use the WiFi on this, the N80 process was long and VERY tiersome to connect up!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>*Battery life in store seems SO much better than the N80, my N80 would need ot be charged most nights, especially is using WiFi or the cam, be aware though that you can half the battery life of what r.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>views tell you as they do not take in to acount what you are using are are calculated in a lab whihc does not take signal stregth in to acount, meaning that if you are in a weak signal area for your network your battery life will not be long.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>*Something to also take in to acount is the menu system, not sure wether this is just me, but i find the menu system really complicated and not intiative, and you will be spending the best part of a week rememebering where things are with in the menus.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>*the screen size is much larger than the N80, and it's lost some of it's weight as well, whihc is a bonus.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>We took some pictures on it's 5mp cam, and it was very good!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>how ever, where it will fail is at night time, as they still haven't built in a proper xeone flash... come on nokia!!!!! catch up with the cybershot technology on the Sony!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It is a shame!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>how ever in day time the pictures are great!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Do not be fooled by websites such as ebay sellers who claim it has DVD like video capature, this is not the case! it does VGA 30fps, that is not DVD like how ever it's like the N80 and is far supirior than any other phones video recorder.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Where the N95 really shines is in it's processor.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It is with out a doubt the most powerfull one i have seen on a phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>To demonstrate it jsut go in to a store and ask them to show you the games, you will be hard pushed to tell the difference between the graphics on the n95 and that of a playstation 1... maybe even 2! It really is that smart!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In conclusion, it is far supiror to it's predesossor, and Nokia have seemed to have ironed out the bug problems the N80 died of, it's quicker and more powerfull.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>How ever it's new and i only had 3 days with it, so time will tell, but i really hope it does well... it needs too, and as of yet it's biggest competitor Sony have not released anything with 5mp on it or anything as powerfull as this...which is also a shame.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's light, it's bright, it's powerfull, and it's a nice looking phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The dual slide worries me a a bit though as it can be a bit anoying when it keeps going in to different menus.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The short cut keys need more work on them, but it is very customisable so i shoudl imagine you can get round it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In all it is the best handset out at the moment, and should be at ?500!    p.s. you'll LOVE the music player! the sound is great out of the stereo speakers!</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>Hello N95 Fans  I have used N95 before for 5 months.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Only difference you can see in New 95 is 2.8inch display instead of 2.6inch, Battery is 1200mah instead of 950mah.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>8Gb internal memory instead of 160Mb, No Micro SD Card slot, Weight 129gm compared to 120gm and 1mm length more.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Symbian OS 9.2, S60 rel.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>3.1 is same for both, so the software and application bugs will be same of old N95.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Application manager crashes N95 OS several times, this is a major Issue.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Keypad is a great disadvantage for N95, it get loosened so fast.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Mine is loosened in am month usage.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Same thing, the old keypad will be there in New 8Gb N95.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Design look too old.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Not Stylish.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Nokia have to compete for other good mobiles vendors.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I bought the Motorola MotoRockr E6 mobile last month.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Its too good mobile with enormous features.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Ofcourse the camera is 2mp, it takes a sharp image in outdoor.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Rockr has a business card reader, that scan n recognize the business cards and store into its phonebook.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Wifi is not there, but I am using wap in Opera browser more user freindly due to its touch screen facility.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Touch makes its user friendly as compared with N95.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Not even one time Rockr E6 OS is crashed for me.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Rockr's performance is far far better than N95.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It has 1000mah battery which gives 5 days battery backup with less usage.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>You can watch movies, songs mp3 in 64 channel output.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Movie quality in sound and video is amazing and superb and battery backup also too good.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>U can easily watch around 3 movies continously around 3:00 hrs each (total ard 9:00 hrs), still after u will get battery backup to another day.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Mp3 Playback of 14 hrs continuous.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Overall features are 2 times more than Nokia N95.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Once if u use, u will feel the difference, that why I am critising Nokia N95.</sentcont></sentence>

<reviewtitle>The All-In-One IT Gadget</reviewtitle>
<rating>0.9</rating>
<pro><sentence>
<sentcont> I can use it in any country since it is unlocked</sentcont>
<sentcont>Extremely multifunctional</sentcont>
</sentence></pro>
<con><sentence>
<sentcont> Reboots automatically without warning- I could be browsing or opening up a PDF and sometimes it would reboot on its own</sentcont>
<sentcont>perhaps due to over usage?!</sentcont>
</sentence></con>
<freereview><sentence><sentcont>The other Nokia phones I owned before this amazing N95 are 3310, 6801, 6600, 6680, & N70 and older models which I can not even remember.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I??ve never tried using any other brand, except the blackberry which I am forced to use for work.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I had my eye on this N95 because I love taking pictures and this phone has a 5 mega pixel camera w/ auto focus Carl Zeiss lens.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>To my surprise, there was so much in stored for me!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This ultimately tops any gadget I ever owned.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It is also the most expensive phone I have, but I believe that it is well worth your money since it is used heavily on a daily basis.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If you add up the cost of a cell phone + 1G micro mini memory card + MP3 player + GPS + digital camera + camcorder + video player (btw-you could hook the phone to your tv and play your videos or a photo slideshow w/ music)+ radio+ fast browser + and so many pluses etc..</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>You would be well over $1,000 if you purchased each of those items individually.I know that most people complain that the phone is "plastic like" but I can tell you that I dropped my phone on a flight of marbled stairs and it surprisingly only got 2 scratches and nothing was cracked and it still works fine (thank God cause I was going to cry!)To show you how useful and amazingly productive this all-in-one phone is, allow me to describe how my day went during a recent trip to Santa Monica.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This is in addition to making calls and sending text messages.Before</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>getting out of bed in the morning, I connected to the internet via our wireless network and checked my email.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Then, I checked my calendar (which was sync to my desktop outlook) to look up the details of my flight.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>At the airport, while waiting for my flight I used the calculator to compute my expenses and the internet to check my email and even kill some time browsing and bidding on eBay.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I also secretly used the camera in the front to make sure that my hair was tidy and my teeth were clean (it??s like looking in a mirror, ha ha!).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Then I plugged in my earphones to listened to the radio.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Still at the airport, while waiting outside the bookstore, the phone was in my bag.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>My ringing tone goes off and since the ???Say Caller??s Name??? option was selected, I knew it was my husband calling me before I even looked at the phone to see who it was.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This function is so handy especially while you are driving.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>You can concentrate on the road without the distractions and hassles of finding your phone and reading your caller ID to see/know who is calling you.On the plane, I listened to some talk shows and music that I previously uploaded for my trip.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Btw- it is so easy to transfer these from your computer to your phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>You could also download these via rss feeds.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Upon arriving I took some photos and videos of the beach and our hotel using the 5megapixel camera.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>While chilling in the room I played some games that I downloaded from getjar.com.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Then I used the map to browse nearby restaurants and get the addresses and directions.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I also sent a text message to Google to get instant results for the nearest drugstore.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I did this by typing ???location, drugstore, Santa Monica??? and sending the message to 46645 which is Google SMS here in the US.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I instantly received several listings via text messaging.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Before going to bed, I set my alarm clock and checked my email and browsed for a bit and watched a few YouTube videos from the video centre.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I also watched some of the videos I took earlier at the beach.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Finally, I visited mobible.org to read the psalm of the day and then plug my earphones in to listen to the rest of my talk shows and quickly fell asleep.With this phone, I easily eliminate bringing the following items on this trip which is really the equivalent of additional luggage:- alarm clock- calendar- calculator- map- yellow pages- mirror- laptop- camera- camcorder- radio- mp3 player- gameboy/psp/DS- all the chargers/ plugs/ batteries that come with these gadgets- and yes that thick heavy book, the holy bible ??For those who are debating whether to get this all-in-one phone, I say YES it is well worth it only if you are planning on utilizing and maximizing all the functions.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If you do not need all the functions, this phone is NOT for you and you should not splurge just to have it because the technology may be too complicated for you.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Seriously.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>For those who already have it  CHEERS!!!</sentcont></sentence>

<reviewid>000004</reviewid>
<reviewtitle>carry your computer on your pocket</reviewtitle>
<rating>1.0</rating>
<freereview><sentence><sentcont>Nokia's N95 superphone is complicated, taking days for even the most experienced gadget journo to digest.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>That's why lots of reviews I've seen so far are either extremely light or 10,000 word stunners: This is one of those long ones.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's likely easier to pore over the phone yourself in our hardware and software gallery walkthroughs, and come up with your own opinion.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But If you want the text heavy version, here's what's great and terrible about this phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Aside from call quality, why Nokia's N95 Rocks:1.GPS:</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The GPS is really GPS, not some assisted-GPS that Sprint and Verizon have in their phones.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>That means you can really navigate with it, like I did, to streets around SF I wasn't too familiar with.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>(Specifically, the corner of Washington and Cherry, close to where the Zodiac killer blew away a Cabbie so many years ago.)</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The point of interest database is sizable and you can search for things by proximity (the nearest ATM or liquor store), and then get the phone dialing right up.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Turn by turn is a subscription that'll cost you about $10 a month, and the voice nav won't read street names, but that, and the phone's persistant Lag aside, it rocks.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>2.Camera: I detect a decent level of grain in these 5mp shots, and the shutter lag is horrendous, but WTF, it's a 5mp camera with a Carl Zeiss 2.8/5.6 autofocusing lens in a phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>There are great controls for ISO, white balance, sharpness, contrast, and flash.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>And video comes in at 640 by 480 at 30fps.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Not shabby.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>And the editing programs are powerful, especially the photo editor's clip art feature.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Proof is in the pudding: Check out Flickr's N95 photos.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>3. Lifeblog: Like other N-series phones, this one can post any text/video/image you take with the phone to a blog.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I'm addicted to this.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This can be done through the Lifeblog software, which will combine text and images into a blog post on Typepad.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The phone will send pictures Flickr's API, too.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>(And via Flickr's blog API, can send photos to most other blog ware.) Right now, Vox is the only site that will accept automated upload videos.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But I'm willing to bet there's even a youtube uploader out there, considering the Symbian OS's dev community.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>4. Media Playback: The mp3/video player is fairly straight forward, and that's why I like it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The speakers are unreasonably loud, in a good way, for a device of this side - as loud as the Samsung K5 with external speakers - and there's an EQ as well as visualizations.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>File support includes MP3/WMA/M4A, and AAC support for those soon to be unlocked iTunes/EMI files.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The media playback buttons aren't the easiest to press, but they add to the simplicity and dedication this device has to AV. Add in support for Podcasts, even those of the video variety, and you're talking.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>(MPEG-4, H.264/AVC, H.263/3GPP, RealVideo 8/9/10) 5. Extras: I admit this is cheating on a list of 5, but all the little included apps really help bring the Nokia up.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>There are office document readers/editors, a standard convertor, calculator, zip utilities, GPS utilities, VOIP (Gizmo Project), a uPNP media server, and all your basic txt/sms/email/browsing/bluetooth, on and on and on.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Feature-wise, it is what a phone could be, given today's technology, minus phone carrier greed.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>(All in our feature walkthrough.)</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Why Nokia's N95 Sucks:1.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Battery: No matter what anyone says, the battery life on the N95 isn't good.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>You can justify it by considering how much power true GPS, WiFi, and those booming speakers take.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Even turning off 3G access, as you won't find reception in the US, the phone will be begging for DC after an 18 hour day of moderate/heavy use.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>2. HSDPA Europe only: This phone is a European variant, and its WCDMA 2100 radio can't tap Cingular's US band HSDPA.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So, you're stuck with EDGE speeds when you're not close to WiFi.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Here's a tip: Turn off the 3G support to save some battery life.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>And get used to using WiFi for the heavy Audio/Video Tranfers.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>3. Laggy OS: I don't know whether to blame Symbian or Nokia, but I don't really care, who's fault it is: This phone is sluggish.5.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Hardware Feels Junky:Two words: Fisher Price.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>They should have packed these components into a denser package.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The world's most powerful handset is also the thickest modern phone without a QWERTY.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But consider all it does, and the fact that its still pocketable, and you can over look its rather portly 0.8 inch thickness.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Full hardware rundown here.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>5. Price: $750 dollars is an unsubsidized price, and I commend Nokia for bringing this unlocked beast of a phone to the US without carriers who'll lock up both the SIM slot and the multimedia features.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But that's a lot of money.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I'd find that more acceptable if the GPS didn't require a subscription, the office software edited without buying an upgrade, and if the rest of my complaints were firmly answered.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>You have to use this phone for yourself (or go on through the walkthroughs below) before you spend this much cash on a portable computer/phone/thingy.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Even then, only the die hardest phone geeks and those who can benefit from the phone's liveblogging capabilities should consider it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>??</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>Hi guys.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I would like to give some different look on the comments of this phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I am still thinking whether go for this phone or not.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Besides I have some bad experience with N80 last year.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I played with a N95 of a friend of mine, but just for 2 days so I cannot make some solid conclusion based on such short experience.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So I am very cautious.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Let us try to make some objective and reasonable judgments in order to get a more comprehensive picture of the, let call it this way, "the real N95":).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Having read a lot of opinions here (I am following them from the beginning of the year) I would try to draw some of the main groups of problems giving some general or specific comments on cons.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Also to point out not only the weak points but also the strong and "innovative" features.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>(Because it can obviously be seen that the majority of posts here are totally opposite - one are saying "this is the best phone I have ever had", while the other are saying - "this is the worst phone, dont buy it".</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So let?s group the points of interest like this.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>1.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Battery life; 2.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The 5 MP camera; 3.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Video; 4.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The phone hangs; 5.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Problems during a call; 6.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>GPS; 7.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Music; 8.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Display; 9.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Robustness of the design.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>1.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Battery life.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The disappointing battery life was expected.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In the posts from January-February a very few guys were reporting the phone should be charged daily or even twice a day; because only few had the chance to use the pilot release and because the rest were dazzled by the specs of the phone and eager to get some kind "Lord of the phones" (there were such expression in a post here).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Nevertheless, having the experience with N80, everyday charge is something very boring.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Especially after elapsing the first one-two months when the delight of using such a complicated device is gone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The second battery partially solves the problem but still you have to pay to much care for that - always to have the spare battery charged, to replace batteries when the one in the phone is drained.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The other approach is to restrain from playing with the wifi browsing, or shooting videos if you are on the move during the day and cannot plug in the charger.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In a moment you start asking yourself - does the phone serve you or you serve the phone?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Or there are some ?tricks? to prolong the batt life - disable 3G, or reduce wifi sensitivity, or not to shoot to much, or not to listen to the music too much, or not use the GPS, etc - well, why should you buy such device if you do not use its features?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Someone here were giving the example with Ferrari - they say the Ferrari consumes too much fuel but still it is a Ferrari - ok the comparison is not that correct.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Fuel consumption is not the analogue of the power (battery) consumption though both are related to energy; here the issue is the USABILITY OF PERFORMANCE ?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>a ?fuel</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>hungry" Ferrari is giving its full performance to the user, but a ?power/battery</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>hungry?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>phone cannot deliver its potential to the user because it simply cannot last enough to give the overall performance to be consumed (?overall?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>means all features, not use only gps, or use only camera, or only make voice calls).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If you have a Ferrari, would you close it in the garage and drive it rarely ?on last Sunday of the month?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>or would you enjoy it everyday as much as possible - if you are happy with the speed and acceleration, etc of a standard car, why should you go for a Ferrari?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Right?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>However let?s gulp down this problem and take it for granted that we cannot have normal battery last in a ?multimedia?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>N-phone (?normal? is something between 3-5 days; or at least firmly over 2 full days (48 hours), regardless of usage of the features, OK?).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Of course some will say - well you have all-in-one device, so how could you expect longer time?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>OK, to that statement I would oppose the above mentioned question - do the phone serves you or you serve the phone?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>And what is better, to have 10 separate devices that are giving their full performance, or one single device combining them but giving you just one feature at a time of all these 10?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Is it a kind of philosophical question?:)</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>no it is a technical question - the device should support all the features it is designed to.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Again with the car analogy ? the car should perform as a car despite of whether you dirve it in the summer (hot) or in the winter (cold), or whether you drive it in a sunny day (no light, heaters, fans, etc) or in a rainy evening (with all electrical stuff switched on), Right?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So, in the end, there is no excuse for the poor battery life.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>2. The 5 MP camera.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It is clear that a phone camera will never be at the level of the current dedicated cameras.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So wheter it is 5 MP or 3.2 MP, it is almost the same.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Further more, it is welknown that Nokia still cannot reach the quality of the SonyEricsson competitors in the mobilephone cameras.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So do not expect the unexpected in this area.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>No need to go deeper in the subject, everything is clear I think.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>3. Video  Here I think we should give the deserved for the phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The feature of VGA video shooting is very very nice.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Again to expect hte quality of dedicated videocamera is irrelevant.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But compared to the CIF and QVGA resolutions in previous phones, the VGA video in your phone is quite usefull and handy.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>4. The phone hangs  Well this should be precicsely specified when it hangs.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>We cannot expect this phone to behave like a computer, desipte that it is equipped with a 330 MHz processor.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>At the time of the 300 MHz Pentiums we had not have so rich multimedia content, right?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In my N80, I couldn't open a pdf or doc bigger then 800-900 KB.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Here we also have 64 MB RAM, of whic about 20-22 MB free (as far as I saw when played with a N95).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Here may be the ad "a multimedia computer" plyes a bad joke for the users - remember this is not a computer, so do not expect to perform like a PC (how often your PC hangs when running some big or complex stuff?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>for me, relatively often the Windows Media Player or Real Player hang when starting a movie).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But the bad thing is that the phone realy behaves slow when opening the images/videos.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>that is something that I definately observed in my short test with the phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>5. Problems during a call (Noise or fuzz or buzzz or whatever during a call)  That is a serious problem (if present).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I have not noticed it but saw several posts about it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So pls say how many of you have noticed it in your phones.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>6. GPS  The chipset in N95 is a Texas Instruments one, not a Sirf III or RFMD, or not even a Sirf II.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So do not expect to have the performance of them.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Here the real problem is in the time to wait for lockon the satellites.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Waiting over 3-4 minutes makes the GPS a thoughtless feature.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Lot of people complain they were waiting 10 or even 15 minutes for "satellite signal".</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>(Me personally could not start the gps at all ...).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The other "problem" here is that the phone could not use the built in GPS receiver with third party navigation programs.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>On the phone I played with, I used a Holluv Sirf III GPS and connected it via Bluetooth to N95 and it worked perfect with TomTOm6.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But why is the built in GPS chip than?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Concerning the maps of "over 100 countries or so" - the idea of having all the info accessible from a app like smart2go in the Nokia is very good.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But still it is not yet fully-usable worldwide (apparently).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But still it is a very good idea so let us be more patient and understanding.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So about the GPS we may want a lot of improvements, both in the phone firmware and hardware and in the info database from Nokia.    7. Music  Playing music is better than N80.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>About the sound quality - I expected much better from the "stereo" speakers.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But if you plug in good earphones (not these coming with the phone) it is absolutely ok.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Again do not expect this device to sound like your home stereo.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>8. Display  Notably worse than in N80 - we have larger screen with smaller resolution in N95.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It is obvious when look on the very nice data given in the gsmarena.com</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>review:   Nokia N95 	40 x 53 mm 	240 x 320 pixels 	3,623 pixels/cm 2  Nokia N80 	35 x 41 mm 	352 x 416 pixels 	10,204 pixels/cm 2    9. Robustness of the design  Some people, also in the reviews, it is reported of noises when sliding the slide, or when pressing the buttons on the slide.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This is something that was present in N80 too.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But in N80 also the battery door on the back was loose, something that in N95 is amended.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>WHen we have a slide, it just could not be as robust as the bar.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If you were not bored in reading all this, I would ask you to help in trying to expand the list of problem groups.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In this way we can justify reasonably and get a clear overall picture of "the real N95" and not just to say - this is the a "crown", or this is a "rubbish".</sentcont></sentence>

<sentcont> GPS maps should've been pre-installed on the memory card </sentcont>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>Purchased N95 last week.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Before I used a 8801, N93, N80, 6270, 6280, Razr V3, Sony Ericsson w850i, e.t.c....too many to list.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>For those of you who are still wondering weather or not it's a good phone for the $, if you have an extra $700 - this is the phone to get.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It has all the features that the phone can have, excellent camera, GPS, e.t.c.Let me start with the camera.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I can only say positive things about it, since it provides excellent pictures not only outside, as many of other users stated, but in the dark as well!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The color balance is great.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Although I would wish some optical zoom...</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I took some pictures in a totally dark environment without any light - came out great!! This can really substitute for a digital camera, if you don't care about optical zoom.GPS needs upgrading.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I didn't find any pre-loaded maps, and you need a wi-fi connection to download them.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Speaking of which, i found wifi to be a great upgrade over the N80's first edition.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>N80 always gave me 'out of memory' errors whenever browsing the web, as I'm a heavy i-net user, working as an IT. On the other hand, you can see Nokia fixed it with the N95.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Only once I got that same error message, while having multiple apps running on the background, which is understandable with MP3 player, Real player, Snakes 3D, and browsing the web.The phone comes with the 'downloads' link, where you can download some nice free apps as well, such as antivirus, games, ringtones.Bluetooth</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>works great, I would suggest one to download an upgraded version of Nokia PC Suite (6.83 I believe) because it fixes many known bugs.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Mp3 player is great too, it comes with visualizations, so your friends will go 'WoooooooW'!!!!The battery life is desent for this type of phone with that many features.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Nokia once again upgraded the battery to BL-5F.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's a litttle bigger, but provides a much longer talking time over the other N-series.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Using the phone all day, playing MP3's for an hour at the gym, with bluetooth turned on all day long, it finally needed charging at night.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Finally, the video camera also doesn't disappoint.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The videos are great, although not DVD-quality like Nokia suggests, they are the best I've ever seen on a cellular phone, much better than on the N93i.One more thing I wanted to mention -- the phone is very well balanced, and feels great in hand.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I love the slider, eventhough it's not an 'assisted one', it still feels much better than over the worst sliding mechanism - N80.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The buttom row of buttons (* 0 #) is very close to the edge, which can make it hard for text messaging.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The number pad, on the other hand, has a great feel to it, so you don't have to look at it all the time while dialing (I txt message a lot, so had to memorize all the letters)).So, for thouse of you, folks, that are still wondering what to do with your $700...</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>September 26th     Nokia have announced the Nokia N95, featuring an innovative double slide design with multimedia controls and a keypad on opposite end of the phones.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Read on for full details, pictures and the full press release.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Summary: The N95 is Nokia's first HSDPA (3.5G) device, but also boasts Wi-Fi, WCDMA, quad-band GSM, Bluetooth (including A2DP), IrDA and USB 2.0 connectivity (via  mini USB connector).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Other hardware features include a 5 megapixel camera, a built in GPS, TV-Out, 3.5mm audio jack, FM Radio, a MicroSD memory card slot and 150MB of internal memory.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In the hand the most impressive aspect of the device, given its feature set, is its size.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>At 99mm x 20mm x 53mm (90cc), the N93 packs an impressively amount into a small space.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Nokia have managed to add two major technologies to the Nseries line (GPS and HSDPA) while significantly reducing the volume of the device.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In length and width dimensions it is larger that the other Nseries slider - the N80, but it is considerably thinner.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>HSPDA is the next generationin cellular connectivity.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The N95 is a category 6 HSPDA device which means it is up to 10 times faster that WCDMA (3G).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Clearly HSDPA support is required at a network level, but many networks have already begun their testing or roll out periods.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The faster connection speeds make downloading media (such as podcasts via the in built Podcast application) more palatable and should also improve latency/round trip times.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Wi-Fi, WCDMA (3G) connectivity, together with quad band GSM and EDGE are also supported.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Bluetooth 2.0, IrDA and USB make up the local connectivity options.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The 5.0 megapixel camera uses Carl Zeiss Optics with autofocus and digital zoom with a dedicated 2 stage capture button on the side of the phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Video capture at near DVD quality is also supported.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>On the side of the device there are several buttons dedicated to camera usage.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This allows the device to be held in a similar way to a traditional camera with the screen, in landscape mode, used as the view finder and the shutter button on bottom right hand side of the device (top right when phone is held horizontally).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>On the rear of the device, next to the camera is the slide switch, which is used to open the lens aperture and activate camera mode.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Although it is difficult to judge the image quality at this stage the evidence we saw suggest that the N95 will be on of the most capable camera phones available.</sentcont></sentence>

<sentence><sentcont>Although it is difficult to judge the image quality at this stage the evidence we saw suggest that the N95 will be on of the most capable camera phones available.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>A GPS is integrated into the device with anticipated accuracy of around 10m (satellite signal permitting).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The devices will ship with an application called Maps which has global overview maps built in.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>More detailed maps (with coverage over more than 100 different countries available) can be downloaded for free from an online server.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The detail available varies from country to country, but in many cases it is available down to street level.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>A point of interest (POI) database is also included.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>All the maps are available for free, as is basic route planning, but navigation functionality (with voice and on screen prompts) will be available as a pay-for add on.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>City Guides will also be available for purchase and other services are likely to be made available in the future.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The mapping software and services is likely to based on technology from gate5, a company which Nokia recently announced it was acquiring.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Music playback is also a major focus of the device.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The dedicated multimedia keys on the top flip of the device are primarily designed for music playback (although can also be used in other multimedia contexts).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Wireless stereo sound output (via the A2DP Bluetooth profile) is also supported, and stereo audio output is also supported by the TV output feature and the on board stereo speakers.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The music formats supported include MP3, AAC, AAC+ and WMA.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Video playback on the QVGA screen is excellent and supported video formats include 3GP, Real Video and MP4 with support for the latest AVC codec.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The multimedia key now leads to a revamped application and multimedia shorcut view which now supports both a greater number of shortcuts (applications, multimedia files and bookmarks) and more flexible personalisation.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>As a result it  is now a more generic shortcut key mechansim and offers an alternative to the standard application launcher.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The N95 uses S60 3rd Edition Feature Pack 1 (Symbian 9.2) and as such includes version 2.0 of the open source Nokia web browser (supporting WML, XHTML and HTML in one browser), Flash Lite 2.0, FOTA (firmware over the air updates) and more.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The N95 uses the same small power port as other S60 3rd Edition devices, but the in-box charger is considerably smaller than the existing models (up to 60% smaller).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The N95 has a 950 mAh battery, it is likely that the N95 will require a daily charge with moderate to heavy use, although 3-6 days may be possible with lighter use (dependent on network strength, type and other factors).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The N95 will be available in Q1 2007 and the approximate unsubsidised price is ?550. Initially it will be available in the EMEA market.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It will not be officially available in the US although gray imports are very likely.</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>I eagerly awaited the launch of this phone and got it on the first day of launch.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It was great in terms of design.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Although in many ways it looks like a brick, compared to the N80, the N95 is slimmer and lighter and packs more features.The</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>best part was the wifi connectivity it offered.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Although in terms of battery life, you may not be able to sustain the handphone while surfing wirelessly all day, it did change the way i used the internet.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Booking tickets online was a breeze (i could just connect in a hotspot at starbucks).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I could still be on MSN while away from my computer.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I used the VoIP whenever i could find a hotspot, thus saving on hefty phone bills through free calls.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>There were many.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Surely the E65 would have offered me the same wifi advantages plus a longer battery life, but this was running on Symbian OS 9.2 and had a larger and clearer display.The</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>2-way slider was great when it came to viewing videos.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Having such a large screen and speakers that could go real loud, it was almost an ipod video by itself.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I rarely used the music player buttons however and the only reason i found myself sliding the other way often is to rotate the display view.The 5 megapixel camera is a godsend.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Although i could not really take clear pictures compared to a normal 7megapix camera, it was great for a camera phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The bigger deal was the video.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Videos have never been this clear on a camera phone before.I didn't try using the visual radio service as i wanted to avoid any GPRS charges so as to keep my bill as low as possible.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So far my bill dropped by about 30% with VoIP calls and wifi surfing instead of GPRS.Here comes the sad news - This phone can be equally as bad.I used it almost as i would use PC.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Although i cannot view videos on youtube, i was able to download some and view on the realplayer.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>While i was at it, once i stumbled upon some 50mb video.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Halfway through the download i was worried if the phone could support such a large file and cancelled the download.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>My web became inaccessible.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Everytime i clicked on web, it would auto-close application.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Even after a few restarts the phone was still the same.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I then had to install a browser software to clear the cache (the root of the problem).Another</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>major problem is that the N95 auto-closes applications when they are not in use for a small period of time.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Supposing you were in the middle of a game and had to attend a 2 minute call.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Once you're done, your game has already been closed.I also had some embarrassing moments with the Music player.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I'm happy that it came with the headphone jack.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>However, when i accidentally loosened the connection between the jack and the phone, the music player automatically switched to speakers and started blasting my music in public.Another</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>problem was that when using the provided earphones with the music control, the music is momentarily played on the speaker for a second or two when you're switching tracks while playing the music.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Yet another embarrassing moment.The 2 way slider is another big problem.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So much for advertising "What's in your pocket?" when the phone is so pocket unfriendly.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Imagine this, when the phone is put inside the jeans pocket, it tends to slide upwards to reveal the keypad since the slider is that smooth.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It slides the other way when it is removed from the pocket.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So usually when i take it out, the display is in landscape mode and that makes me look unprofessional sliding my phone all the time.My 1.5 month old N95 recently went for repairs after the display light died.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The phone was still perfectly working.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Just the display backlight.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It was a slow death from the heavy usage from someone like me.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Thankfully there's a firmware upgrade for this phone and i hope it will solve some of the many problems for the N95.</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>Published: September 30, 2006    Nokia is really starting to up the ante in the race to build the perfect multimedia phone, or "multimedia computer", as the company likes to call them.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Their new N95, officially launched today at the Nokia Open Studio event in New York has a spec sheet that should make even the most die-hard pessimists drool a wee bit.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The device looks much like the N80 slider that is currently on the market, but hidden inside that somewhat blocky shape is a 5 megapixel auto-focus camera, a GPS receiver, and HSDPA 3G and WiFi 802.11b/g data support - to name but a few of the highlights.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>One noteable physical difference between the N95 and the N80 that it looks so much like is the N95's dual-direction slider mechanism, which exposes an extra row of hardware buttons for controlling multimedia playback.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The new auto-focus, 5 megapixel camera unit, Nokia's first, makes use of Carl Zeiss optics, just like the N93 and N90 do.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Images and videos can be uploaded to a number of different photo gallery and blogging systems.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Videos can be recorded at VGA resolution at 30fps, and can be recorded with digital image stabilization.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>A TV out function on the N95 let users enjoy their works of art on a larger screen, too.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The N95 also supports MP3, AAC, M4A, and WMA music playback through its built-in stereo speakers or headphones attached to its 3.5mm headset jack.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>An FM radio is also included in the N95.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Another new trick for Nokia is the built-in GPS capabilities found in the N95.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The N95 comes pre-loaded with a mapping application that covers over 100 countries worldwide.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Viewing the maps should be a pleasant experience thanks to the large 2.6" QVGA (240x320) display that can show 16 million different color shades.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Perhaps most amazing, considering all of the new capabilities, is the fact that the N95 is a few millimeters thinner than the N80, and weighs 15g less - coming in at 120g total.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>All of this multimedia power should be available to consumers in Q1 of 2007 at a price of around 550EUR before taxes and network subsidies.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Nokia USA says that the N95 will not be released in the United States, but that they will offer "something similar" with the same technologies in 2007 for the North American market.</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>(Oputs Australia Reseller)  I have a couple of quick quiestions about the N95 and hope to get some answers before it hits Asutralian shores.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>1.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In a few movies of the N95 ive seen on YouTube i notice there is a cord hanging out of the phone is this a security string or is it a usb cable inside the phone (that would be very handy).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>2.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In Australia on the optus network we have a thing called FindA which allows me to find other people that have FindA and see where they are, I was wondering with the nokia N95 is it possible to link up with someone on GPS and find out where they are, Once again i saw this displayed on YouTube.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>3.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Is this the same software as the nokia N73 (by that i mean Symbian 3rd Edition) if so where is a good place to purchase or download good software, Also do you think this version will be backwardsa compatible with older Symbian software.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Thats all i have to ask but here are some things i need to say to the people on this forum.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>1.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Yes the N series is the multimedia/PC phones of the future but lets think about it i think if you need touchscreen to complain about the N95 just go get a PDA, If you dont like the battery life dont buy the phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>You have to remember Nokia Techs dont just go lets throw this battery into the phone they have to do major research to see which batery will last the longest and which one works best for the phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>All you fan boys of sony ericsson better relise that my shop has most of the SE i sell returned due to faults and since then ive stoped selling SE in no way am i saying Nokia is better i just think SE.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>should stick to other things (Remebering Sony makes alot of stuff and Nokia only makes well Phones so who do you think has the bigger budget and better researchers) The only reason people love the SE camera phones is because Sony makes cameras so its natural for them to combine them and bring out a wicked camera phone but guess what the rest of the phone is terrible and not worth buying.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So in the end if anyone wants a good price or plan just email me at aaronandlarissa@gmail.com.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Peace</sentcont></sentence>

<reviewtitle>1st Class Phone</reviewtitle>
<rating>0.9</rating>
<pro><sentence>
<sentcont> Great all-round device that does everything </sentcont>
</sentence></pro>
<con><sentence>
<sentcont> Slight delays when using some functionality </sentcont>
</sentence></con>
<freereview><sentence><sentcont>Having read the editor's review you'd end up thinking that the phone didn't look that good, have great build quality or respond well, and possibly also that it wasn't the best thing since sliced bread.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The truth is that this is one of the best looking and feeling handsets out there.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The build quality is very solid and it's snappy for all the key phone functions.Having</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>used every kind of handset ranging from the Palm based Treo to a multitude of Windows and Series 60 phones over the recent years they've all fallen well short of being an ideal phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This is the first one which genuinely starts to deliver the goods.The</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>overall feel of using the N95 is that it is simply phenomenal and without doubt is a milestone in mobile phone development.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I'm fortunate to be based in London and get to benefit from all the 3G goodness and speed, and have to say that the browsing, navigation (GPS) and multimedia goodies such as playing the games on my wide screen television make this handset an unbelievably useful and fun device.Other</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>great features are the performance for syncing, it used to take ages to sync a Nokia phone, but this one syncs faster than you realise, so much so, that I've set it to auto sync via Bluetooth whenever it's near my laptop.The 3G connectivity means that surfing and emailing through the PC or N800 are now a joy on the move as well as in the office.The</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>other thing to note is that the connectivity in general and especially the Wifi works extremely well.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The phone seems to instantly detect wireless networks, at least three or four times faster than Windows and allows easy switching between the wifi and 3G connections allowing you to save on your bandwidth bill.What is clear though is that some of the functionality is in effect 'back-up' to dedicated devices.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I'd always prefer to take photos with a dedicated digital camera although the camera works very well in good light (although it is slow).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The GPS (Maps) application is great and the ability to drill down into street level in villages in Hungary (where my wife is from and currently visiting) is something I've never found before in a GPS device.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I would still use my Nuvi though to navigate around most of Europe since it does a great job and has a bigger screen.This is also the first Nokia which is 'standard' in that it has standard headphone jack and USB connectors.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It means it actually starts to feel like a tiny computer rather than simply a phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If you compare the performance of this device with PCs it comes on top in all kinds of scenarios.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The multi-tasking nature of the N95 is also great.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It allows you to flick through songs using the dedicated keys, whilst reading a travel guide and plotting your route to the next destination, all to be gently interrupted by an incoming call with a 3D ringtone which zooms from one side to the other.Having looked at some of the reviews and my own experience, and compared them with the editor's review it's clear that the editor has got this one seriously wrong.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I can appreciate that there's a couple of disadvantages in using the handset in the US but even then the general performance should simply blow you away.There's no device that comes close to this phone as an all-round handy device which really works.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It certainly means I'll be carrying a lot fewer devices on a day-to-day basis</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>27 September 2006 - Launching around the globe on the same day, Nokia has opted for one big hit rather than pacing the launch of its latest products over several weeks or months.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Pocket-lint managed to get a brief first look at its "Hero" phone, the Nokia N95 expected to be available in February 2007 at the UK launch event in Soho, London.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>While even the Nokia spokesman keen to show us the phone professed that he had seen it for as long as we had, our initial first impressions are very good.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Quoting Simon Ainslie the new Managing Director of Nokia, who recently joined from operator T-Mobile "There isn't much that it doesn't do" and when you look at the phone's features we, like Nokia, are hard pressed to see what's missing; 5 megapixel camera, 3G, wireless connectivity, dedicated music buttons, HDSPA, even GPS and bar missing a QWERTY keyboard you're pretty much there.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Nokia has even gone as far as using the slogan ?It?s what computers have become".</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Wanting to be more than just another phone, the device comes with a dedicated maps application that includes maps for more than 100 countries and covers more than 15 million points of interest on a separate CD that you load into the phone depending on what you need and where you are.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In our brief encounter we weren't able to see the GPS element in action.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The more conventional, but far from ordinary, is the announcement that the phone packs in a 5 megapixel camera boasting a Carl Zeiss lens, but no zoom.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Nokia isn't the first to announce a hike in megapixel count, LG and Samsung are already all over that one, but it's good to see that Nokia isn't prepared to be left behind.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Unfortunately we weren't able to take any images away with us to see the quality, but the interface looked similar to other Nokia camera handsets and the 2.6-inch QVGA 16 million colour display screen certainly gives you a camera feel.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Luckily Nokia seems to have resisted the urge to put a rather large lens cover a la the K800i from Sony Ericsson instead opting for a robust, but thin lens cover which does the job just as well.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Other features include HSDPA, or 3.5G, the N95 also supports WLAN, EDGE, and WCDMA networks, 3D graphics, built-in stereo speakers, a 3.5mm audio jack, a microSD card slot, and mini USB socket.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So it must be a brick, like the N93 - "the size of a house" one Journalist next to us asked - well actually it's rather small, slightly bigger than the N71 but still very compact and bijou.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Bored with the clamshell, candy bar or regular slider, the N95 enlists a triple slide function - up for the numerical keypad, down for the dedicated music keys, which are, in the model we looked at, slightly hidden and rubbery to touch.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The main keypad itself is, thankfully, rather staid and boring and Nokia has resisted the temptation as with previous models to make you jump through a series of hoops to simply dial a number.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The front of the slider, aside from the large screen that dominates the design features call, hang up and select buttons as well as the menu button with its strange icon (now in its third year) and a multimedia button that zooms you to the multimedia features.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Nokia users will also be pleased to hear that the interface looks identical to current models and the Finnish company hasn't chosen this moment in time to do anything too drastic here either.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>VERDICT  The form factor hasn't changed much over previous models (apart from the extra sliding function), however what has changed is Nokia's emphasis and embracement of every technology that you can manage to fit into a small device.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In the past, when phone manufacturers have mentioned convergence, it's normally that they've managed to get an camera or MP3 player into there phone and boosted the memory a bit.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Here Nokia has managed to not only cram that camera (all 5 megapixels) and MP3 player (with new accompanying music service) in to the phone, but it's gone one step further and added a plethora of connectivity features and GPS to boot making this a multimedia fan's ultimate fantasy.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>What's even more impressive is, that unlike the N73, which looks like a Sony Ericsson Walkman rip off, or the N93, which with its built-in camcorder is bigger than you would perhaps want, the final design is small compact.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Will this replace all Sony Ericsson's handsets (the K800i, the M600i and the W810i) in one foul swoop?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Time will tell come launch day, however based on our initial brief encounter, if the features perform under closer scrutiny, then Nokia might finally see themselves back on top once again.</sentcont></sentence>

<sentence><sentcont>well , after reading so much of comments which , i should say i never thought i will end up with this n95 , with so much of lag despite its so call fast processor inside but compared to other N series , n95 is indeed faster.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>here are a few disappointments.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>the shortcut media button on the frontbesides the direction pad does not work sometimes & its actually supported by sliding the phone down revealing the play & forward buttons , i meant by sliding it down also shows the shorcuts created.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>then by sending all sms , mms to memory card will definitely slow the process of creating & opening sms , so i decide to have them directly into phone .</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>and total disappointment on the camrera .</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>i never had trusted any camera from nokia producing good quality photo shots even with carl zeiss lens supported .</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>super slow start up , super slow save when shuter is pressed & whats with the zooming system when the lens cannot even focus good on anything ... gps & wifi works average for me , though connection not so stable yet .</sentcont></sentence>

</sentence></pro>
<con><sentence>
<sentcont> Battery life poor, but it is fine w/ a nightly recharge, not made of anodized aluminum </sentcont>
</sentence></con>
<freereview><sentence><sentcont>This phone does everything imaginable.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's pretty much a full computer in your pocket.Camera:5MP is phenomenal for a cell phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It also has many advanced functions such as aperture settings, exposure compensation, white balance, self timer, and red-eye flash settings.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>On top of that, the video camera is very very good but not DVD quality as Nokia says.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It even has image stabilization built in.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In other reviews, you may have read that the "camera was slow" or something along those lines.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The truth is that the shutter itself is not slow, but the response time between pushing the button and the clicking of the shutter is long.GPS: Really useful and neat feature to have.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Be sure to clear all maps first using the PC map loader (if it was not bought in the US--mine was an Asian model) Then load your US maps into the memory card.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The map goes down to street level and is fairly up-to-date.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The accuracy of the GPS is around 150 feet.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It even indicates altitude and speed of your vehicle.Video/Music Playback:The media centre of this phone has some impressive animation, and plays videos and songs in stereo sound with impressive quality.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Plus, it can be hooked up to any TV so you can blow it up on a larger screen.WiFi:Fairly good.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Regular sites don't load as fast as a normal comp, but that's because of the overall processing power/RAM of the unit.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>WiFi also saves you on expensive data costs that you would prob encounter with your wireless carrier.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's really useful for checking email and browsing your favorite sites.Bluetooth:The</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>EDR really helps when you sync your media files from your computer.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It also helps increase the range between your computer and the N95.User interface:The Symbian OS is very intuitive and clean.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Occasionally, it lags but this wasn't a big issue for me.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Even more complex apps like the Map application loads and quits efficiently without hanging up.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The unit only freezes after applying a more complex setting such as changing the system theme or something.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It can be fixed by a simple restart of the device.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>However, this should've been fixed by Nokia through a simple message telling you to restart your device the way you'd restart your computer after installing an update or program.Battery:This</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>seems to be a big point of critisism for the editors and other users of this phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The honest bottom line is this: it doesn't go about 14 hrs without a recharge.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>(that is w/ use of WiFi, GPS, and Bluetooth).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If you use the phone just for talking w/ idling, the battery lasts a comfortable 21 hrs.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The best thing to do is to probably charge it overnight daily.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Then you'll be fine.PDA</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>functionality:The address book, calandar, and document viewers are excellent.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Multiple numbers per contact w/ room for email addresses, home addresses etc.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The calandar has many options for appts, meetings, and alarms.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The document viewer not only opens regular text docs, but also spreadsheets and some kind of file that resembles PowerPoint.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Checking email is also easy as setting up your account with the wizard is a snap.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It works of WiFi or through your wireless carrier.Screen:The</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>size is really nice and the important info such as time, date, etc show up nice and large so it's easy to read.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>For videos and the GPS, it's perfect.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The ambient light sensor works well.Physical</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>feel:The phone has a solid feel.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's also slimmer than it looks.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>When I saw the pics on the Nokia site, it def looked thicker than when I actually had the unit in my hand.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The fact that the sliding mechanism isn't assisted isn't a big deal for me.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The two-way slider is also pretty neat.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>However, the slider, when open, has a slight flimsy feel to it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's also made of plastic, and not anodized aluminum like a lot of new electronics (eg.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>iPod) which is surprising for such a high-tech device.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The plastic is wrapped tightly and solidly around the device though and doesn't "squeak" or "creak" when being handled.Overall, this phone is really THE THING as it surpasses the typical smartphone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Despite a few minor faults, it is an amazing device with tremendous functionality.</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>I'm dying to add a comment here!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I gotta admit when I first got this phone for upgrade at end of April, I told everyone its probably the best phone you'll ever use in your life (and I still think so to this day, u gotta admit it is) and I wouldn't let anyone say a bad word against it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>the second day after i got it, the gps was taking ages to connect so i took it to the shop where the store manager said give it 24hrs after you pay the ?40 charge to nokia then it'll work fine as "he had the same problems" i thought fine.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>and then it worked.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>ok, now ive had it about a month n a half, n i see why so many ppl complain about it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>i dont even bother use the gps now its just hopeless, and when it does connect, it gives wrong directions as it so slow, especially if you're driving over 50mph on the A12!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The slide is too loose, the battery is TERRIBLE, oh my god, and that bloody symbian operating system that the N series swears by needs a makeover, its such a slow operating system.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>All in all, fantastic phone, if you want a superb camera, video recording, excellent music quality, wi-fi and a host of other small features, also most downloadable due to the symbian-ness and working.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>for Carphone Warehouse i would still recommend it, but if you're buying it mainly for the fact the it has all those features AND with the benefit of built-in GPS, then your best option (and cheapest) would be maybe a 3.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>2mp camera phone like the Sony Ericsson K800i/K810i Samsung U600 etc BUT buy a stand alone satnav unit.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>which if you go to carphone warehouse our cheapest one is on sale now for only ?99.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>99 (a lot less than the ?40-?50mth line rental per month for 18mths required for purchase of the N95.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>).</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>Till today I have never had the courage to name any phone like the best one on the market with clear conscience.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But Nokia N95 does deserve this label.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It has no adequate competitors on the current mobile market: it is extremely rich in functions, has a comfortable and detailed user interface with plenty of settings, and on the top of it, it is a relatively light and compact.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The most notable drawback of Nokia N95 is its battery life.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It will require daily doses of power, unless you limit its usage to occasional calls and messages, deactivate 3G, Wi-Fi, and GPS, and play no videos.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In this case you may happen to postpone charging by a couple of days, but is such use worth the purchase of a phone like Nokia N95?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The answer is no.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Of course, battery life is an individual matter and depends on many factors.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Nevertheless we can assure you that during our intensive tests we had no other option but to charge the device sometimes even twice a day.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The first batch of Nokia N95 hit the market at a high price.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Even so it was immediately sold out.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The main delivery whose price is said to be a bit lower is being expected at the end of April.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Anyway, the price remains rather high, perhaps due to the strong customer demand.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Nokia N95 may be very expensive, but it also offers a lot and thus keeps attracting numerous prospective buyers.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In this sequence of thoughts it is quite probable that in a few months, when the initial ecstasy falls off, the price of the phone will also fall down a bit.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Be prepared, however, that drops in price will hardly be significant as Nokia N95 will continue to be the best phone in the world for a while and will thus manage to easily maintain its price.</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>If you loved a lot features that you maybe will never use it, and slow response and phone easy to freeze, and expensive get this phone!!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Until nokia can make phone that really reliable, and maybe I buy one, Lot's of my friend have this phone, but they can't show me nothing but the receipt of how much they pay for phone that...just phone!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Media player hard to manage, it can play video, but is all N95 owner know how to put video in it?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>And the GPS, I bet most of the N95 owner buy the unlocked one and the map that pre installed not they home country,and did you even have the GPRS service?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Otherwise you cannot use the GPS, and I did try it.. the map interface so slow.. I even find my way my self, before the map finish loading.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>And 5Mp cam?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Camera is to take and save moment so you can keep it..but N95 camera so slow..the moment just pass before you can take it, N95 owner..you might use 2Mp unless you planing to print your picture bigger dan 10x8, otherwise 2Mp it's enough detail.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>DVD quality camcorder..again..the moment pass on by the time the phone ready.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Wifi..is it free yet ?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>16M color.. did you count it ?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Get phone that you can really use it, I love feature in N95.. but sorry..</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I don't need them all.</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>GOOD:??The Nokia N95 cell phone boasts a 5-megapixel camera that produces good-quality photos and videos.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It comes with advanced multimedia capabilities and has a 3.5mm headphone jack.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The Symbian smart phone also features integrated GPS, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth, and an innovative two-way slider design.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>??BAD:??The N95 lacks support for U.S. 3G networks; standby battery life is poor; and performance is somewhat sluggish.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The hardware feels a bit cheap, and the sliding mechanism could be more secure.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's also very expensive.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>??BOTTOM LINE:??With a 5-megapixel camera, advanced multimedia capabilities, and GPS, there's no doubt that the Nokia N95 is one of the most feature-packed smart phones to date, but poor battery life and sluggish performance make it hard to justify the high price tag.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>?? ??</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>I read and hear people discuss this phone and some enthusiasts are adamant about it being fast.From</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>personal experience I know this phone is slow!5mp camera,gps,wi-fi etc is great but i'm not sure of the need for symbian os(=slow phone).What</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>real benefit does it offer on a set like n95?do you really want to install 3rd party programs that are fairly poor c'mon how many of you guys need to use those symbian applications?isn't it far far better and more appropriate to use your notebook?I mean it's not like your ever going to do anything serious on a n95.</sentcont></sentence>
