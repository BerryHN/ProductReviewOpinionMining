<freereview><sentence><sentcont>If you have upgraded the software(fw)it does preform a little better but yes the device is quite slow.Install</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>3rd party apps onto memory card and free up as much RAM as possible.Hopefully</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>future firmware will make the unit preform faster.To the other guy-Nokia are heavily tied with symbian so unfortunately if you want a nokia smartphone you have to put up with symbian inadequaties.</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>Lots of questions are going on about this phone here I see.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Well lets start from the bottom.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>For the dude who talk about ASIA with the 1-MP phone, Sorry buddy that phone you're talking about is barely a concept in development by Samsung and Sony that prove to be a current failure.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Both company fine the phone to be difficult to pack so much features into it when it's incompatible with other neccesary things.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The network for those phone doesnt even works here in the US so please stay relevant to your post and be sure you are talking about US compatible phone here.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The touch screen is the one thing i hate most on phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Wait and see the Iphone get complains about their touch screen and finger print.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>People demand for things they cant accept, weird.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Also, if you EVER had a chance to even Touch one of these n95, you would know the n95 map ALSO have a 3D option for the map and it does show which direction you're facing my friend.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This show that you are Clueless about the phone itself.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>2GB isnt so tough in Japan.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Nokia already surpass that that line with the N91 Black edition with 8GB, please check on that and ill get back to you about how much better Nokia is.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Sliding phone has been out since the 90s in Asia?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>well if am not wrong, the flip phone and bar phone been out since before sliding and sliding phone is making big hit right now in over all sale, also please read more on that.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Ok now that we answer your issue lets move on.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Yes this phone should work with the Asia area map, if its not there is always an option where you can pay your service provider to give you the even BETTER GPS service that navigate you throughout then country and so forth.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So worry free my friend.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The optical zoom and digital zoom make great differences but with this phone ive been using it on digital zoom and it works fine.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Some of you dont know but this N95 does have an IS(image sabilization) unit install inside.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So it also have a decent image with even digital zoom.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Trust me, for a camera phone this N95 wont get old anytime soon.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The battery life of the N95 isnt as bad as most of you said it is.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Ive gone two days without charging on it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If you buy this phone and use it like a media device more than a phone then please do expect the phone to drain out of its juice.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Just to remind some of my friends here that this thing is a phone after all.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Even with a big battery the Sony PSP can only provide about 6-7 hours of game play.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Most other electronic device with media cant do any better.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So for a phone that last you an entire day with GPS and gaming and mp3 and big pixel camera, its holding up very good.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Just be sure to lower the lighting and the WLAN search of you are not using it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>As for the TFT screen quality, its a phone screen.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Why are there people talking about HDTV quality here?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>its not a TV!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Its a HD phone!.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Maybe you guys are not spending enough time to convert your video files.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Im getting exceptionally good quality off of my videos and every where i watched it people are wowful into the qualit it produce.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Even the new Iphone can only offer the same amount of colors.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>To what i know, this N95 wont be out class until another AT LEAST 1 year.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The time i bought one of the first 2mp camera phone, it take THIS LONG to have something surpassed it. 2 WHOLE YEARS just to surpassed a 2mp phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>5mp?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>it's going to take a while.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Do any of you hear anything about SE or samsung crawling any where near 4mp yet?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>they are barely stuck on 3.2 mode.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Sony are so proud of their 3.2 right now they are partying over it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Samsung as we all know ever since the D900 3.2mp they didnt really improve much on megapixel either.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Apple iphone which will release soon with all these ALMOST comparable features still have to bow down to the N95 5mp.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So in term of US compatible phones, the N95 will stick around for a LONG time.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Even its forefather the N80 can still beat most of the phones out there.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Japan make good phones i admit, but there is a different between a Good phone, and a EXtrEmEly Good PHONE!.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>We all know European get real advance when it come to the extreme stuffs.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Cars, phones, Convention, and other technologies.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So The ASIA Phone Talk need to listen to the European Phone Talk now.</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>sorry guys ,but you are comparing the N95 to the HTC and you really are not fair.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>just comparing symbian (N95) to windows mobile  5.0 0r 6.0 (HTC, I-mate, ASUS,....) is not fair, because windows mobile is by far more important, applicable ,and above all stable.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>no, it is not true that symbian does not lock or freez, the true is that symbian is the worst oparating system as far as stability is concern.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>moreover, symbian compared to mobile windows is complicated for simple casual users, while windows ....even a 5 year old boy can work on it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>so, please be objective and stop praising the symbian machines because someday nokia will shift into windows.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>finally let me tell you the N95 cons    1- very low battery life.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>2- 5 mega picture with NO natural colors.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>3- the GPS is SIRF II not SIRF III this means that sensitivity is low.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>4- the GPS can not work with other than the build in applications.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>5- it freezes 2-3 times per day and you need to remove the battery to restart it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>6- the restart takes about 1-3 minutes.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>7- very slow menu navigation.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>8- No handwriting screens  9- no keyboard  10- no jogdial.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>so guys the only innovation in this phone is a big screen, and even it is not that big.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>so pray that the nokia engineer will reach a day to update the n95 firmware to solve these issues.</sentcont></sentence>

<sentcont> Freedom, 5mp Camera, 850,900,1800,1900,2100 3G, Functionality, GPS, MP3 Player, Wi-Fi </sentcont>
</sentence></pro>
<con><sentence>
<sentcont> No QWERTY board, No touchscreen, kind of big </sentcont>
</sentence></con>
<freereview><sentence><sentcont>First of all i would have to say this phone has the best speakerphone i have ever had on a cell phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Very crisp, and can be turned up extremely loud.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I've had it for almost a year now, and I haven't had any problems with it. it works great, you can use one hand to operate it and it's??jus that??easy.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It has everything you would want in a cellphone well i believe.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Batterylife, well, I only make calls when needed or if it's really important.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>because it consumes your battery more than if you will send text messages.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Instead.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I highly recommend it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It offers a lot of options.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>However I would have to say on the other hand the call quality of using the handset is??above average to me.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Even when the volume is turned all the way up, it is sometimes??easy to hear who you are talking to on the other end, and that can be annoying lol depending on who it is.. (:-) .</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Sometimes I am forced to turn the speakerphone on when I would prefer to use the handset when in the car??without blue tooth.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The downloadable applications are very impressive, alot of options as far as those are concerned.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The camera takes great pics.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The battery does get used up fast when you are using the applications.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>One other thing is that the lcd screen will scratch and show marks, so I would highly recommend some type of shield or screen protector.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Overall a solid phone, I would say above average in most aspects.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>let me tell you before buying this phone i did alot of research on a number of phones and i chose this one.I had a list of things I wanted in a phone and I have to say, this phone not only had everything I've ever needed, but I was surprised on things I didn't know about!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>For instance, I didn't even know it had an accelerometer when I bought it!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But for now I'll just list the major features and review them:  CAMERA(s): The main 5MP camera takes great pictures.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Obviously it's not the same quality as a stand alone, say Sony Cybershot of equal quality.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But the different scene shots and bright flash make up for that.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>(portrait, night shots, fast-moving, etc) Video is as good if not better than a Sony Cybershot point and shoot camera.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>(You can even edit pictures right on your phone!)CALL QUALITY/SPEAKERPHONE: Call quality has been very good.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Speakerphone is VERY loud thanks to the pair of high quality speakers.GPS:</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The assisted GPS antenna on the device is pretty good.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>When using Nokia Maps to navigate, it takes very little time to connect (5-10 secs mostly) You have to keep the slider open however to get good signal.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If you don't like nokia maps, you can always buy/download other software like Google maps, TomTom, etc. Very handy.BLUETOOTH:</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Basically like any other bluetooth.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It can connect to headsets, other devices, computers, and it also is compatible with A2DPEMAIL: It its own email client that you can set whatever address to or you could use the free Gmail app if you have gmail.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>(thats what I do)MUSIC PLAYER: 8GB memory.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>To today's standards, thats not a very big size for a primary music player.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>However, when you transfer music to the device from Nokia's PC Suite, it asks you if you want to convert the songs to a smaller format (~5 times smaller) which is very helpful in storing more songs.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Other than that, its a great player with many features.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>(Playlists, shuffle, album art, EQ, etc) Great speakers too.WiFi/3G:</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>WiFi connects very quickly and smoothly.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>3G signal is great too.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Every now and then it will cut out but will automatically continue.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Even reaches 3.5G speeds (HSDPA) on AT&T's network.CALENDAR:</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Nicely laid out with many viewing options.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Can add new memo's, tasks, meetings, and anniversaries.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Can also sync with computer.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>(Assuming outlook, but don't use)ACCELEROMETER: VERY cool to have.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Enables the phone to auto-rotate when phone is flipped sideways.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Also automatically straightens pictures that were taken sideways.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>And MANY more applications that you can download that use the accelerometer like games or cool apps like Step Counter.COMPUTER SOFTWARE: Didn't realize this was a big thing until I tried to sync a Blackberry to a computer one time.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Not very user friendly.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But Nokia's PC Suit is the most simple, yet powerful sync program I've ever seen.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Can easily use phone to connect your computer to the internet with the touch of a button.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Or you can read, sort, and reply to your text messages on your computer.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Very, very nicely designed.BATTERY</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>LIFE: As the N95 was my first smartphone I've ever had, I didn't realize this was as big of an issue.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But sadly on the N95, the battery life is terribly underrated for the many features this phone has.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I charge it every night and even when doing minimal things on the phone, it will usually die around 6pm.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Nokia knows this, which is why they offer different types of portable battery packs and ways to charge your phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Gets very irritating at times but just make sure you carry an extra battery or 7 around with you.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>:)  So overall, this phone has been everything you really need in a phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I get comments all the time on the lack of a touchscreen and full keypad.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Truth is, you really don't need either.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The predictive text function does the job good enough and touch screens don't do much for me.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This phone is focused around applications.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>There are hundreds and hundreds of applications (usually free) you can download that do anything from make your phone into a portable lightsaber to turning your phone into it's own WiFi Hotspot.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The options are limitless with apps."</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>I grabbed my n95 day of release, thrilled to think that one year ago the rumours that were being spread of an n83 had truly been turned into the actual n95.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>now i'm having seccond thoughts...was it worth my $1254 aud?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>yes i know i cbf shopping around.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>firstly, gps- so slow.... takes me about 5 minutes to conect to sat.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>although i've never used another gps system, i am guessing this is not normal.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I have heard other people complain of this too, but they say it gets quicker with time.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>loading google maps is good, but the onboard mapping system is just as good i think.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>i've found google maps requires you to have internet connection to be able to see the actual map(so great if ur in a wifi area.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>but bad if u don't have cheap gprs connections...) anybody know a workaround?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>onboard mapping software allowed me to see where i was without connection to network.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>although i was driving 15 minutes away, it took 5-8 minutes to connect to sat.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>to get coordinates and then after another 2 mintues of fumbling buttons to set destination and start trip calculations, i was about 200 m from destination (i had to park because i wanted to see it in action!!!)    so when it was working it seemed fine.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>but, as other people have found, voice nav.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>requires $$$$ and it came up with an annoying statement etc asking me to subscribe.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>imagine i was really lost, there goes my $ subscribing to year of nokia maps.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Actual phone is a bit of a letdown, lags, resets itself randomly (4times in 4 days) keep pressing menu button by accident instead of left or right arrow key.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>so what i have big thumbs.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>camera lags when on 5mp mode.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>havnt tried any other mode.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>but its about 2-5 seconds b/w pressing the button to take pic and actually seeing the image on screen of ur final pic...strange.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>on n95 screen, pics seem a liiiitle grainy...    wifi keeps dropping me out.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>well, this may be due to my network, and i hope it is for the n95s repuation... but it really shits me.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>downloading videos off the included reuters links, get dropped out from wireless...    3.5mm headphone jack is great.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>great sound quality, i personally believe (although i havn't heard it through a good pair of headphones) inbuilt speakers have an amazing ability to project themselves...and also have an amazing ability to split ear drums with high pitched onboard nokia tones...argh!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Battery life is the other m a j o r letdown.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>with using wifi maybe 5 minutes, gps on my 15 min car ride which turned into 20 cos i stopped to play with gps, about 5 minutes of normal call time and 5minutes of bluetooth call time and about 3 minutes of speaker call time, my battery is wailing for a charge as I type.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>-i have not got more than one day with propper use of functions without either needing to charge or noticing it was on one bar and thinking it would die tomorrow if i listen to mp3.</sentcont></sentence>

<sentence><sentcont>god i love that phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>=P    So after closely following rumours and exclusive reviews posted all over the net, desperately awaiting the device that is not just one thing, it's many.... i've almost convinced myself its not worth the price.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>ALMOST.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>-happy with reception (as you would expect fomr a high end phone)  -dual slide ability is fantastic   -screen is awesome, colorful, bright biiiig...  -music playback is to me ipod comparable (well i have 3gipod,time for new1)  -inbox equipment is more than generous.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>nokia included 1gb in the box and shop gave me a free 2gb...so thats sweet.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>inbox case is pretty protective and stylish...although i have worries about camera safety.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>~my zeiss optics!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>IS N95 WORTH IT??? DOES IT LIVE UPTO THE HYPE???  well, i'll leave that up to you to decide, i still can't decide.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>basically, i think, if you have the means, get it, but if ur jobless like me...don't waste all your money on release date!!! haha -but its damn sexy.</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>hi PFQR,    I have over a dozen appz and 80+ games downloaded free on my N73, so i would say it  is definitely the "best" possible all rounder set i can get.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>if anyone got $ to spare, they can always buy the N95, but i would say it is not a very rational decision to pay such a high premium over N73, for things like 3.5 mm audio output jack, TV out, dual slide mechanism, Wi-Fi, and 5 mpg camera.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's battery life, if you take note, is also less than N73's.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Map applications, if available, is also at a cost to user for usage i believe.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>First batches of any new nokia models always comes with bugs etc, so y be the first to get it?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Mobile phones prices also drop drastically over 3-6 mths anyway, and when 6 months or more passed, you be seeing newer models like, maybe N97, N99 or watever new nokia models again.........so wat's the point of getting one set so fast, for the sake of it?</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>Hi guys.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I would like to give some different look on the comments of this phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I am still thinking whether go for this phone or not.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Besides I have some bad experience with N80 last year.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I played with a N95 of a friend of mine, but just for 2 days so I cannot make some solid conclusion based on such short experience.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So I am very cautious.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Let us try to make some objective and reasonable judgments in order to get a more comprehensive picture of the, let call it this way, "the real N95":).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Having read a lot of opinions here (I am following them from the beginning of the year) I would try to draw some of the main groups of problems giving some general or specific comments on cons.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Also to point out not only the weak points but also the strong and "innovative" features.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>(Because it can obviously be seen that the majority of posts here are totally opposite - one are saying "this is the best phone I have ever had", while the other are saying - "this is the worst phone, dont buy it".</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So let?s group the points of interest like this.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>1.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Battery life; 2.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The 5 MP camera; 3.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Video; 4.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The phone hangs; 5.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Problems during a call; 6.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>GPS; 7.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Music; 8.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Display; 9.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Robustness of the design.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>1.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Battery life.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The disappointing battery life was expected.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In the posts from January-February a very few guys were reporting the phone should be charged daily or even twice a day; because only few had the chance to use the pilot release and because the rest were dazzled by the specs of the phone and eager to get some kind "Lord of the phones" (there were such expression in a post here).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Nevertheless, having the experience with N80, everyday charge is something very boring.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Especially after elapsing the first one-two months when the delight of using such a complicated device is gone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The second battery partially solves the problem but still you have to pay to much care for that - always to have the spare battery charged, to replace batteries when the one in the phone is drained.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The other approach is to restrain from playing with the wifi browsing, or shooting videos if you are on the move during the day and cannot plug in the charger.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In a moment you start asking yourself - does the phone serve you or you serve the phone?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Or there are some ?tricks? to prolong the batt life - disable 3G, or reduce wifi sensitivity, or not to shoot to much, or not to listen to the music too much, or not use the GPS, etc - well, why should you buy such device if you do not use its features?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Someone here were giving the example with Ferrari - they say the Ferrari consumes too much fuel but still it is a Ferrari - ok the comparison is not that correct.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Fuel consumption is not the analogue of the power (battery) consumption though both are related to energy; here the issue is the USABILITY OF PERFORMANCE ?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>a ?fuel</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>hungry" Ferrari is giving its full performance to the user, but a ?power/battery</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>hungry?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>phone cannot deliver its potential to the user because it simply cannot last enough to give the overall performance to be consumed (?overall?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>means all features, not use only gps, or use only camera, or only make voice calls).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If you have a Ferrari, would you close it in the garage and drive it rarely ?on last Sunday of the month?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>or would you enjoy it everyday as much as possible - if you are happy with the speed and acceleration, etc of a standard car, why should you go for a Ferrari?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Right?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>However let?s gulp down this problem and take it for granted that we cannot have normal battery last in a ?multimedia?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>N-phone (?normal? is something between 3-5 days; or at least firmly over 2 full days (48 hours), regardless of usage of the features, OK?).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Of course some will say - well you have all-in-one device, so how could you expect longer time?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>OK, to that statement I would oppose the above mentioned question - do the phone serves you or you serve the phone?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>And what is better, to have 10 separate devices that are giving their full performance, or one single device combining them but giving you just one feature at a time of all these 10?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Is it a kind of philosophical question?:)</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>no it is a technical question - the device should support all the features it is designed to.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Again with the car analogy ? the car should perform as a car despite of whether you dirve it in the summer (hot) or in the winter (cold), or whether you drive it in a sunny day (no light, heaters, fans, etc) or in a rainy evening (with all electrical stuff switched on), Right?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So, in the end, there is no excuse for the poor battery life.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>2. The 5 MP camera.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It is clear that a phone camera will never be at the level of the current dedicated cameras.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So wheter it is 5 MP or 3.2 MP, it is almost the same.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Further more, it is welknown that Nokia still cannot reach the quality of the SonyEricsson competitors in the mobilephone cameras.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So do not expect the unexpected in this area.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>No need to go deeper in the subject, everything is clear I think.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>3. Video  Here I think we should give the deserved for the phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The feature of VGA video shooting is very very nice.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Again to expect hte quality of dedicated videocamera is irrelevant.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But compared to the CIF and QVGA resolutions in previous phones, the VGA video in your phone is quite usefull and handy.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>4. The phone hangs  Well this should be precicsely specified when it hangs.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>We cannot expect this phone to behave like a computer, desipte that it is equipped with a 330 MHz processor.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>At the time of the 300 MHz Pentiums we had not have so rich multimedia content, right?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In my N80, I couldn't open a pdf or doc bigger then 800-900 KB.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Here we also have 64 MB RAM, of whic about 20-22 MB free (as far as I saw when played with a N95).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Here may be the ad "a multimedia computer" plyes a bad joke for the users - remember this is not a computer, so do not expect to perform like a PC (how often your PC hangs when running some big or complex stuff?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>for me, relatively often the Windows Media Player or Real Player hang when starting a movie).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But the bad thing is that the phone realy behaves slow when opening the images/videos.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>that is something that I definately observed in my short test with the phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>5. Problems during a call (Noise or fuzz or buzzz or whatever during a call)  That is a serious problem (if present).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I have not noticed it but saw several posts about it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So pls say how many of you have noticed it in your phones.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>6. GPS  The chipset in N95 is a Texas Instruments one, not a Sirf III or RFMD, or not even a Sirf II.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So do not expect to have the performance of them.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Here the real problem is in the time to wait for lockon the satellites.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Waiting over 3-4 minutes makes the GPS a thoughtless feature.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Lot of people complain they were waiting 10 or even 15 minutes for "satellite signal".</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>(Me personally could not start the gps at all ...).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The other "problem" here is that the phone could not use the built in GPS receiver with third party navigation programs.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>On the phone I played with, I used a Holluv Sirf III GPS and connected it via Bluetooth to N95 and it worked perfect with TomTOm6.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But why is the built in GPS chip than?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Concerning the maps of "over 100 countries or so" - the idea of having all the info accessible from a app like smart2go in the Nokia is very good.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But still it is not yet fully-usable worldwide (apparently).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But still it is a very good idea so let us be more patient and understanding.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So about the GPS we may want a lot of improvements, both in the phone firmware and hardware and in the info database from Nokia.    7. Music  Playing music is better than N80.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>About the sound quality - I expected much better from the "stereo" speakers.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But if you plug in good earphones (not these coming with the phone) it is absolutely ok.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Again do not expect this device to sound like your home stereo.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>8. Display  Notably worse than in N80 - we have larger screen with smaller resolution in N95.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It is obvious when look on the very nice data given in the gsmarena.com</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>review:   Nokia N95 	40 x 53 mm 	240 x 320 pixels 	3,623 pixels/cm 2  Nokia N80 	35 x 41 mm 	352 x 416 pixels 	10,204 pixels/cm 2    9. Robustness of the design  Some people, also in the reviews, it is reported of noises when sliding the slide, or when pressing the buttons on the slide.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This is something that was present in N80 too.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But in N80 also the battery door on the back was loose, something that in N95 is amended.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>WHen we have a slide, it just could not be as robust as the bar.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If you were not bored in reading all this, I would ask you to help in trying to expand the list of problem groups.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In this way we can justify reasonably and get a clear overall picture of "the real N95" and not just to say - this is the a "crown", or this is a "rubbish".</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>September 26, 2006.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Nokia Open Studio 2006, New York, US - Nokia today introduced the Nokia N95, an all-in-one multimedia computer with a pioneering 2-way slide concept, integrated GPS functionality, a 5 megapixel camera and support for high-speed mobile networks, making it easier to watch and record videos, listen to songs, take high-quality photos, browse the internet, or catch up on email while on the move.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>"The Nokia N95 brings a range of multimedia ingredients together, such as a fantastic display, outstanding photo and video capability and high-speed connectivity, making it the ultimate multimedia computer," said Anssi Vanjoki, Executive Vice President, Multimedia, Nokia.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>"This single device - which fits easily in your pocket - can replace stand-alone devices that you no longer need, whether it's your music player, your digital camera, PDA or navigation device.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Most importantly, the Nokia N95 is with you and connected when you want to use it."</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The innovative 2-way slide concept makes it easy to switch between different modes, going from reading maps to watching a video with a simple slide.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>A numeric keypad slides out from one end of the device while dedicated media keys slide out from the opposite direction, converting the display into full screen landscape mode.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>With powerful 3D graphics, the Nokia N95 has a stunning user interface that makes it intuitive to find the features and services you want.</sentcont></sentence>

<sentence><sentcont>You can also purchase additional features, such as city guides and voice guided navigation.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>With the Carl Zeiss optics on the 5 megapixel camera, you can capture print quality photos and DVD-like quality video clips.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Photos and video clips can be enjoyed on a compatible television thanks to the device's TV out feature and support for Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) technology.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Designed for High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) networks and with support for WLAN, EDGE and WCDMA networks, the Nokia N95 provides excellent coverage and speeds wherever you may be.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In HSDPA networks, browsing the internet, reading email, streaming video and downloading large files can be carried out up to 10 times faster than with 3G.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The Nokia N95 also offers a first class entertainment experience with the combination of a large 2.</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>September 26th     Nokia have announced the Nokia N95, featuring an innovative double slide design with multimedia controls and a keypad on opposite end of the phones.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Read on for full details, pictures and the full press release.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Summary: The N95 is Nokia's first HSDPA (3.5G) device, but also boasts Wi-Fi, WCDMA, quad-band GSM, Bluetooth (including A2DP), IrDA and USB 2.0 connectivity (via  mini USB connector).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Other hardware features include a 5 megapixel camera, a built in GPS, TV-Out, 3.5mm audio jack, FM Radio, a MicroSD memory card slot and 150MB of internal memory.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In the hand the most impressive aspect of the device, given its feature set, is its size.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>At 99mm x 20mm x 53mm (90cc), the N93 packs an impressively amount into a small space.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Nokia have managed to add two major technologies to the Nseries line (GPS and HSDPA) while significantly reducing the volume of the device.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In length and width dimensions it is larger that the other Nseries slider - the N80, but it is considerably thinner.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>HSPDA is the next generationin cellular connectivity.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The N95 is a category 6 HSPDA device which means it is up to 10 times faster that WCDMA (3G).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Clearly HSDPA support is required at a network level, but many networks have already begun their testing or roll out periods.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The faster connection speeds make downloading media (such as podcasts via the in built Podcast application) more palatable and should also improve latency/round trip times.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Wi-Fi, WCDMA (3G) connectivity, together with quad band GSM and EDGE are also supported.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Bluetooth 2.0, IrDA and USB make up the local connectivity options.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The 5.0 megapixel camera uses Carl Zeiss Optics with autofocus and digital zoom with a dedicated 2 stage capture button on the side of the phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Video capture at near DVD quality is also supported.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>On the side of the device there are several buttons dedicated to camera usage.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This allows the device to be held in a similar way to a traditional camera with the screen, in landscape mode, used as the view finder and the shutter button on bottom right hand side of the device (top right when phone is held horizontally).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>On the rear of the device, next to the camera is the slide switch, which is used to open the lens aperture and activate camera mode.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Although it is difficult to judge the image quality at this stage the evidence we saw suggest that the N95 will be on of the most capable camera phones available.</sentcont></sentence>

<sentence><sentcont>Although it is difficult to judge the image quality at this stage the evidence we saw suggest that the N95 will be on of the most capable camera phones available.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>A GPS is integrated into the device with anticipated accuracy of around 10m (satellite signal permitting).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The devices will ship with an application called Maps which has global overview maps built in.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>More detailed maps (with coverage over more than 100 different countries available) can be downloaded for free from an online server.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The detail available varies from country to country, but in many cases it is available down to street level.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>A point of interest (POI) database is also included.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>All the maps are available for free, as is basic route planning, but navigation functionality (with voice and on screen prompts) will be available as a pay-for add on.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>City Guides will also be available for purchase and other services are likely to be made available in the future.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The mapping software and services is likely to based on technology from gate5, a company which Nokia recently announced it was acquiring.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Music playback is also a major focus of the device.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The dedicated multimedia keys on the top flip of the device are primarily designed for music playback (although can also be used in other multimedia contexts).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Wireless stereo sound output (via the A2DP Bluetooth profile) is also supported, and stereo audio output is also supported by the TV output feature and the on board stereo speakers.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The music formats supported include MP3, AAC, AAC+ and WMA.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Video playback on the QVGA screen is excellent and supported video formats include 3GP, Real Video and MP4 with support for the latest AVC codec.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The multimedia key now leads to a revamped application and multimedia shorcut view which now supports both a greater number of shortcuts (applications, multimedia files and bookmarks) and more flexible personalisation.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>As a result it  is now a more generic shortcut key mechansim and offers an alternative to the standard application launcher.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The N95 uses S60 3rd Edition Feature Pack 1 (Symbian 9.2) and as such includes version 2.0 of the open source Nokia web browser (supporting WML, XHTML and HTML in one browser), Flash Lite 2.0, FOTA (firmware over the air updates) and more.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The N95 uses the same small power port as other S60 3rd Edition devices, but the in-box charger is considerably smaller than the existing models (up to 60% smaller).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The N95 has a 950 mAh battery, it is likely that the N95 will require a daily charge with moderate to heavy use, although 3-6 days may be possible with lighter use (dependent on network strength, type and other factors).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The N95 will be available in Q1 2007 and the approximate unsubsidised price is ?550. Initially it will be available in the EMEA market.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It will not be officially available in the US although gray imports are very likely.</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>One month ago I purchased a Nokia n95 in Spain (from Movistar).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In general, my experience with the phone has been very bad, the main reasons for this so desfavorable opinion are:First at all, the Nokia n95 is a very expensive phone with a lot of potential utilities that doesn?t work in the real world.At the beginning the interruptions and blockages were very common, and the change for the new firmware only improves the number of these adverse events, but doesn?t arrange the basic problem.The camera, despite the announced 5 megapixels, is worse than my old nikon with only 4 megap.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The reason is that the lens is not equiparable.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The maximum size with the nokia is 1MB, a small size nowadays that is worse than the obtained with any cheap digital camera.The</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>GPS is very slow to positionate at first, and really, doesn?t</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>work with the slider closed, that makes impracticable to use frequently.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The navigation is not free.....The batteries need to be recharged every 24 hours...Has been impossible to me to connect the WLAN with my router (plug and play????).Finally, the display is fragile, and brokens with a minimal shock.I</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>do not recommend the purchase of this terminal.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Probably, there are better phones from Nokia and no so expensive like this is.</sentcont></sentence>

<sentcont> Low Battery Life, Easily heated up during long calls or VoIP calls, Music player errors, GPS cant connect, 2-way slider</sentcont>
</sentence></con>
<freereview><sentence><sentcont>I eagerly awaited the launch of this phone and got it on the first day of launch.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It was great in terms of design.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Although in many ways it looks like a brick, compared to the N80, the N95 is slimmer and lighter and packs more features.The</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>best part was the wifi connectivity it offered.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Although in terms of battery life, you may not be able to sustain the handphone while surfing wirelessly all day, it did change the way i used the internet.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Booking tickets online was a breeze (i could just connect in a hotspot at starbucks).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I could still be on MSN while away from my computer.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I used the VoIP whenever i could find a hotspot, thus saving on hefty phone bills through free calls.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>There were many.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Surely the E65 would have offered me the same wifi advantages plus a longer battery life, but this was running on Symbian OS 9.2 and had a larger and clearer display.The</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>2-way slider was great when it came to viewing videos.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Having such a large screen and speakers that could go real loud, it was almost an ipod video by itself.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I rarely used the music player buttons however and the only reason i found myself sliding the other way often is to rotate the display view.The 5 megapixel camera is a godsend.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Although i could not really take clear pictures compared to a normal 7megapix camera, it was great for a camera phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The bigger deal was the video.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Videos have never been this clear on a camera phone before.I didn't try using the visual radio service as i wanted to avoid any GPRS charges so as to keep my bill as low as possible.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So far my bill dropped by about 30% with VoIP calls and wifi surfing instead of GPRS.Here comes the sad news - This phone can be equally as bad.I used it almost as i would use PC.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Although i cannot view videos on youtube, i was able to download some and view on the realplayer.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>While i was at it, once i stumbled upon some 50mb video.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Halfway through the download i was worried if the phone could support such a large file and cancelled the download.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>My web became inaccessible.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Everytime i clicked on web, it would auto-close application.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Even after a few restarts the phone was still the same.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I then had to install a browser software to clear the cache (the root of the problem).Another</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>major problem is that the N95 auto-closes applications when they are not in use for a small period of time.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Supposing you were in the middle of a game and had to attend a 2 minute call.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Once you're done, your game has already been closed.I also had some embarrassing moments with the Music player.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I'm happy that it came with the headphone jack.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>However, when i accidentally loosened the connection between the jack and the phone, the music player automatically switched to speakers and started blasting my music in public.Another</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>problem was that when using the provided earphones with the music control, the music is momentarily played on the speaker for a second or two when you're switching tracks while playing the music.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Yet another embarrassing moment.The 2 way slider is another big problem.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So much for advertising "What's in your pocket?" when the phone is so pocket unfriendly.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Imagine this, when the phone is put inside the jeans pocket, it tends to slide upwards to reveal the keypad since the slider is that smooth.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It slides the other way when it is removed from the pocket.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So usually when i take it out, the display is in landscape mode and that makes me look unprofessional sliding my phone all the time.My 1.5 month old N95 recently went for repairs after the display light died.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The phone was still perfectly working.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Just the display backlight.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It was a slow death from the heavy usage from someone like me.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Thankfully there's a firmware upgrade for this phone and i hope it will solve some of the many problems for the N95.</sentcont></sentence>

<sentcont> It is not something that I would take into account when thinking about buying it however, you just have to make sure that you charge it frequently which to be honest most people do anyway</sentcont>
<sentcont> A handy tip is to purchase the Nokia car charger and plug the phone in during all your journeys (long or short) which tops up the power nicely</sentcont>

<sentence><sentcont>nokia will beat all the phones with overall features and connectivity.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>wi fi b/g/i/e on e series most of all the new nokia are quadband.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>e series blackberry.</sentcont></sentence>

<sentence><sentcont>if you want the iphone and like doing sports stick to a n73 or w810i now compare these phones with the n95 so now compare the phones with the ones with the best features iphone vs n95 the only problem with the nokia is that you need more then one battery to use all the features in one day , i phone will have up to 15h mp3 playback ok if you want that get a n73 , 53 or 5700 or a sonyericsson w810.</sentcont></sentence>

<sentcont> WiFi, GPS, Bluetooth 2.0+EDR, Symbian OS based, Map application, large screen, dual slider, intuitive user interface, 5MP camera </sentcont>
</sentence></pro>
<con><sentence>
<sentcont> Battery life poor, but it is fine w/ a nightly recharge, not made of anodized aluminum </sentcont>
</sentence></con>
<freereview><sentence><sentcont>This phone does everything imaginable.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's pretty much a full computer in your pocket.Camera:5MP is phenomenal for a cell phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It also has many advanced functions such as aperture settings, exposure compensation, white balance, self timer, and red-eye flash settings.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>On top of that, the video camera is very very good but not DVD quality as Nokia says.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It even has image stabilization built in.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In other reviews, you may have read that the "camera was slow" or something along those lines.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The truth is that the shutter itself is not slow, but the response time between pushing the button and the clicking of the shutter is long.GPS: Really useful and neat feature to have.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Be sure to clear all maps first using the PC map loader (if it was not bought in the US--mine was an Asian model) Then load your US maps into the memory card.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The map goes down to street level and is fairly up-to-date.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The accuracy of the GPS is around 150 feet.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It even indicates altitude and speed of your vehicle.Video/Music Playback:The media centre of this phone has some impressive animation, and plays videos and songs in stereo sound with impressive quality.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Plus, it can be hooked up to any TV so you can blow it up on a larger screen.WiFi:Fairly good.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Regular sites don't load as fast as a normal comp, but that's because of the overall processing power/RAM of the unit.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>WiFi also saves you on expensive data costs that you would prob encounter with your wireless carrier.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's really useful for checking email and browsing your favorite sites.Bluetooth:The</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>EDR really helps when you sync your media files from your computer.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It also helps increase the range between your computer and the N95.User interface:The Symbian OS is very intuitive and clean.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Occasionally, it lags but this wasn't a big issue for me.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Even more complex apps like the Map application loads and quits efficiently without hanging up.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The unit only freezes after applying a more complex setting such as changing the system theme or something.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It can be fixed by a simple restart of the device.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>However, this should've been fixed by Nokia through a simple message telling you to restart your device the way you'd restart your computer after installing an update or program.Battery:This</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>seems to be a big point of critisism for the editors and other users of this phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The honest bottom line is this: it doesn't go about 14 hrs without a recharge.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>(that is w/ use of WiFi, GPS, and Bluetooth).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If you use the phone just for talking w/ idling, the battery lasts a comfortable 21 hrs.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The best thing to do is to probably charge it overnight daily.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Then you'll be fine.PDA</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>functionality:The address book, calandar, and document viewers are excellent.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Multiple numbers per contact w/ room for email addresses, home addresses etc.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The calandar has many options for appts, meetings, and alarms.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The document viewer not only opens regular text docs, but also spreadsheets and some kind of file that resembles PowerPoint.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Checking email is also easy as setting up your account with the wizard is a snap.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It works of WiFi or through your wireless carrier.Screen:The</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>size is really nice and the important info such as time, date, etc show up nice and large so it's easy to read.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>For videos and the GPS, it's perfect.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The ambient light sensor works well.Physical</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>feel:The phone has a solid feel.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's also slimmer than it looks.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>When I saw the pics on the Nokia site, it def looked thicker than when I actually had the unit in my hand.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The fact that the sliding mechanism isn't assisted isn't a big deal for me.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The two-way slider is also pretty neat.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>However, the slider, when open, has a slight flimsy feel to it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's also made of plastic, and not anodized aluminum like a lot of new electronics (eg.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>iPod) which is surprising for such a high-tech device.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The plastic is wrapped tightly and solidly around the device though and doesn't "squeak" or "creak" when being handled.Overall, this phone is really THE THING as it surpasses the typical smartphone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Despite a few minor faults, it is an amazing device with tremendous functionality.</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>wow thanks for the compliment sir dani hehehe.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>sir lattroteuse, sorry to hear about your unfortunate experience about nokia and the n95, hopefully they will sort it out.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>maybe you can file a complaint at nokia.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>com.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>?.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>dear sir arepeaceDNA,.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>first you can only turn off the camera sound completely if you have a euro1 euro2 or balkan firmware version (just turn the "warning tone" off).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>if you have an asian one or from the U.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>S.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>you may not be able to turn off the sound, there are ways to reflash your unit to euro1 or euro 2 or even balkan firmware though so you can turn the camera sound off.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>or you can just download the application "ccam" it lets you use the camera with no camera sound nor red light.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Quite cool hehehe just search it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>its a free application btw hehehe.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>btw.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>if you have firmware 20 and above, you will notice a significant improvement of the battery life and the super speed of the phone overall ehehe.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>in my case I use my n95 extensively, so I kinda charge it every night.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>my battery is depleted once I use the phone for 6-8 hours.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>used for gaming(most of the time), viewing videos, and using the camera etc.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>and if your phone doesnt vibrate even when its on.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>i think you have a defective battery.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>sir gana,.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>you have every right to change your phone to whatever you choose, If it will make you feel better to change your n95 for an n82 then by all means please do so and you are entitled for your opinion, You can say that n82 is superior(which in some factors, crucial to others, yes it is ).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>but n95 holds its own against n82, minute details that makes the n95 worth considering compared to the n82.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>in terms of flash, xenon is bar none definitely the most powerful and most suited for photography, but using the xenon flash extensively.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>drains the battery big time.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>and in macro or close up scenes.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>there is a high chance you'd get overexposed pics because of the powerful light of xenon.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>whilest on the n95s case, the modest light that the underated led flash emits is really good at macro and closeups, AND you can use it extensively at close intervals in between usage unlike xenon.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>and n95's led flash is one of the most powerful led flashes around beating that of the dual led flash of w960(google it).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>n95 has a bigger screen you can toy around its construction as it is dual slide with bigger and more keys.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>has infrared not as useable for file transfers as bluetooth but you can use it for certain applications such as tv remote.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>motion detector etc has a comprehensive video editing suite on board the phone (which the n82 nor the n95 8gb doesnt have).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>to some, n95 has an edge in form factor over the n82.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>to some n82 is just too classy to compare it to the n95.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>ultimately its your choice no one is stopping you from going with what you want.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>but to n95 users.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>apparently n95 is "the phone" and is simply the better choice.</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>I grabbed my n95 day of release, thrilled to think that one year ago the rumours that were being spread of an n83 had truly been turned into the actual n95.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>now i'm having seccond thoughts...was it worth my $1254 aud?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>yes i know i cbf shopping around.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>firstly, gps- so slow.... takes me about 5 minutes to conect to sat.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>although i've never used another gps system, i am guessing this is not normal.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I have heard other people complain of this too, but they say it gets quicker with time.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>loading google maps is good, but the onboard mapping system is just as good i think.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>i've found google maps requires you to have internet connection to be able to see the actual map(so great if ur in a wifi area.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>but bad if u don't have cheap gprs connections...) anybody know a workaround?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>onboard mapping software allowed me to see where i was without connection to network.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>although i was driving 15 minutes away, it took 5-8 minutes to connect to sat.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>to get coordinates and then after another 2 mintues of fumbling buttons to set destination and start trip calculations, i was about 200 m from destination (i had to park because i wanted to see it in action!!!)    so when it was working it seemed fine.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>but, as other people have found, voice nav.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>requires $$$$ and it came up with an annoying statement etc asking me to subscribe.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>imagine i was really lost, there goes my $ subscribing to year of nokia maps.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Actual phone is a bit of a letdown, lags, resets itself randomly (4times in 4 days) keep pressing menu button by accident instead of left or right arrow key.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>so what i have big thumbs.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>camera lags when on 5mp mode.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>havnt tried any other mode.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>but its about 2-5 seconds b/w pressing the button to take pic and actually seeing the image on screen of ur final pic...strange.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>on n95 screen, pics seem a liiiitle grainy...    wifi keeps dropping me out.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>well, this may be due to my network, and i hope it is for the n95s repuation... but it really shits me.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>downloading videos off the included reuters links, get dropped out from wireless...    3.5mm headphone jack is great.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>great sound quality, i personally believe (although i havn't heard it through a good pair of headphones) inbuilt speakers have an amazing ability to project themselves...and also have an amazing ability to split ear drums with high pitched onboard nokia tones...argh!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Battery life is the other m a j o r letdown.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>with using wifi maybe 5 minutes, gps on my 15 min car ride which turned into 20 cos i stopped to play with gps, about 5 minutes of normal call time and 5minutes of bluetooth call time and about 3 minutes of speaker call time, my battery is wailing for a charge as I type.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>-i have not got more than one day with propper use of functions without either needing to charge or noticing it was on one bar and thinking it would die tomorrow if i listen to mp3.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Although I knew what it's size was before I got it, i still miss the slim 8250 in my pocket.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>god i love that phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>=P    So after closely following rumours and exclusive reviews posted all over the net, desperately awaiting the device that is not just one thing, it's many.... i've almost convinced myself its not worth the price.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>ALMOST.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>-happy with reception (as you would expect fomr a high end phone)  -dual slide ability is fantastic   -screen is awesome, colorful, bright biiiig...  -music playback is to me ipod comparable (well i have 3gipod,time for new1)  -inbox equipment is more than generous.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>nokia included 1gb in the box and shop gave me a free 2gb...so thats sweet.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>inbox case is pretty protective and stylish...although i have worries about camera safety.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>~my zeiss optics!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>IS N95 WORTH IT??? DOES IT LIVE UPTO THE HYPE???  well, i'll leave that up to you to decide, i still can't decide.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>basically, i think, if you have the means, get it, but if ur jobless like me...don't waste all your money on release date!!! haha -but its damn sexy.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>cheers.</sentcont></sentence>

<con><sentence>
<sentcont> The lack of a lens cover and no memory slot </sentcont>
</sentence></con>
<freereview><sentence><sentcont>After using the phone for a week, my 1st impression of the phones were positive.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The overall size of the phone was not as large as thought.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It is a good size phone that fits comfortably in the hands.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Negative side is the make, it has a plastic feeling, its light and seems very breakable.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Phone reception is clear and conversation through the loudspeaker was no problem as compared to other phones.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Taking pictures and video are the best aspect.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>At 5 mp, the pictures are clear and video recording became fun on a mobile phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The are so many apps for the phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Purchasing this, one will find many descent product to add to the Nokia N95.Media playback was an ease with its sliding mechanism.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>One slide to media mode exposes play/pause fast/rewind buttons and screen adjust for full view.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The downside is the software bundle that came with the Nokia N95 8gb.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I find it is great for the average user but those wanting more might be dissappointed.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The lack of a memory slot also made transfer of files a hassle having to connect via bluetooth, usb, or even IR. And the data transfer rate is slow for large files like movies but transferring of songs is a breeze.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Just a list of the main features on hardware:TV out - watched record videos on TVGPS/integrated5 mp camera w/ flashWi-fi8gb memorystandard headphone jackIR portTwo speakers on sideOverall, I love this phone.</sentcont></sentence>
