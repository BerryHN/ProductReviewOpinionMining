<freereview><sentence><sentcont>Well I must say I am very happy i did not buy apple's first iteration of the 13" aluminum macbook last year b/c they really got it right the second time around upgrading it to a macbook pro!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Its nice to have that "pro" stamp on a 13" now!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Apple has listened to their customers adding almost everything we have asked for and more, and managed to reduce the price!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Thanks Apple!.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>CHANGES FROM LAST YEAR.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>- $100 less.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>- 13" aluminum macbooks became macbook pros.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>- 2.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>53Ghz up from 2.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>4GHz dual core.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>- 4GB RAM up from 2GB.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>- led display has 60% greater color gamut than previous model.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>- new advanced built-in battery that lasts up to 7 hours vs 4hrs.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>- FireWire is back (after all the complaints of first model).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>- SD card slot (replaces express card slot).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>- new models now come with iLife '09.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>- separate digital audio input is gone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>- new model uses the same integrated mic and headphone port as the iPhone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>PROS.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>- finally a price cut with a performance upgrade!.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>i knew apple could do it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>i was tired of paying for aesthetics and not performance.??- new Snow Leopard Operating System comes pre-installed!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Same great ease of use with much faster performance!??- much better lcd screen!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>inline with the pro models...still glossy and still some glare but much nicer!??- backlight keyboard on all 13" models now!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>( i really enjoy this as it can be controlled from low to high)??- battery life is significantly better than last year.(</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>i get about 6 hours w/ regular use not the 7hrs that is reported)??- the computer is designed beautifully truly a head turner.??- iLife 09 suite is superb for pictures, movies, and music.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Good software really does sell hardware.??- SD card slot accepts SDHC, which goes up to 32GB and works like a charm.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>(can boot from SD card as well)??CONS??- aluminum outer casing does dent easily if dropped.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>(buy a soft case for it!)??- power cord is short and does not reach as many places as I would like...must sit very close to power outlet.??- battery can't be removed easily??- SD card sticks about half way out of slot.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>eye sore.??- blu-ray option would have been nice but understandable given licensing fees.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>(many blurays are offering digital copies which help)??Taking into consideration all the great improvements over last year with a nice price cut I can now truly recommend this near perfect Macbook Pro!??</sentcont></sentence>

<reviewtitle>Apple's lightest full-featured notebook</reviewtitle>
<rating>0.8</rating>
<freereview><sentence><sentcont>There are lots of positives.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>First, the aluminum unibody design is both gorgeous and practical.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The precision construction gives the whole unit a solid feel.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Aluminum and glass won't wear out like the plastic on many other laptops.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The silver matte finish with black keys looks classy as well.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Fingers glide easily over the large, glass trackpad.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The trackpad also operates as a mouse button -- it takes a small amount of pressure to click it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Other trackpads I've used often register a click just putting my fingers down -- the MacBook Pro's trackpad gives physical feedback which reduces those mis-clicks.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Multiple-finger gestures make it a snap to navigate through documents and websites.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Pressing with two fingers instead of one performs the equivalent of a right click.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Swiping with 2 fingers scrolls the current window.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Spreading fingers apart zooms in; pinching zooms out (similar to the iPhone).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Swiping 4 fingers exposes the desktop or switches between applications.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>These gestures are intuitive and it is hard going back to the Windows laptop after getting used to their convenience (I am really hooked on the 2-finger scrolling).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The keyboard automatically lights up as the room light dims.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This isn't an essential feature (especially for touch typists), but is helpful for picking out the correct function keys after dark.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's little touches like this that make the MacBook Pro a pleasure to use.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Apple put a lot of thought into the design of their power supply.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It has a special connector that attaches magnetically to main body -- so it connects easily and won't cause your laptop to crash to the floor if you trip over it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The connector even has a light that shows it's connected and charging (turning green when the battery reaches 100%).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>A little plastic clip on the cord helps manage its length.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>When traveling, the extension cord can be replaced with a retractable plug that goes directly into an outlet, so there's even less to carry.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The U.S. plug is included with the MacBook Pro, but you can order plugs for other countries.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The solid body, backlit keyboard and MagSafe power supply are nice design flourishes, but the important feature is the long battery life.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>??</sentcont></sentence>

<reviewtitle>Apple MacBook Pro MB990LL/A 13.3 in. Notebook are Nice.</reviewtitle>
<rating>1.0</rating>
<pro><sentence>
<sentcont> great graphics, Speedy navigation </sentcont>
</sentence></pro>
<con><sentence>
<sentcont> price, too hot </sentcont>
</sentence></con>
<freereview><sentence><sentcont>Background: I've been a Windows/PC user for the last  15 years.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I never really seriously considered Macs, due to their price,  and perceived incompatibility with the most popular software.I</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>am an electrical engineer, so I can really appreciate the effort that Apple put into every aspect of the design.I've had this computer now for about two weeks.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I like it more each day.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>What made me finally "go Mac"?A  PC virus that my wife picked up from a Polish gossip website.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It got in  and jacked everything up pretty thoroughly.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I finally got the virus  off, but then Windows wouldn't restart.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I did a recovery, from a special  partition on my hard drive, which promised I would not lose data files,  but that I would lose all the latest applications I'd installed.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It  turned out to be BS.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I lost everything from the last 5 years, including  all my family photos.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>That hurt.As</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I sat there, reloading  everything, removing bloatware, and asking my friends and family to  email me any pictures they have, I thought to myself: "This is crap.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I  shouldn't have to do this, or even THINK about doing it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I'm getting a  Mac."So,</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I researched a bit online.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's sometimes hard to separate  Mac fanboy talk from truth.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Let's face it, Mac people can be pretty  obnoxious.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The place that has been the most helpful so far is  www.mac-forums.com.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>There is a forum there called 'Switchers'.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>A  switcher is what they call PC people who are finally opening their mind  and considering a Mac.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I asked a ton of questions on a thread called  'Mac: A good match for us?' Here's the  link:??http://www.mac-forums.com/forums/switcher-hangout/184691-mac-good-match-us.htmlSome  of those questions and answers may be helpful to you too.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>After reading  through those responses for a few days, I finally couldn't take it, and  had to pull the trigger.On</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>their advice, I bought a refurbished one  from Apple.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This model, the 13.3" Macbook Pro, with 2.26 GHz processor  and 160 GB hard drive, cost the same as the entry level Macbook.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Those  specs are the same.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But the Pro has the milled aluminum enclosure, which  looks nice, as well as a firewire jack and backlit keyboard.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The  backlit keyboard was the real seller for me.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I had gotten used to the  LED light that shone down on the keyboard of my work PC laptop.This</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>little feature is super-nice for those of us who don't like to stop  using the computer just because the sun went down or our spouses are  sleeping next to us.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It is also variable intensity, so it can be just  barely on, or blaring away.The</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>function keys are set by default to  control important things on the computer: screen brightness, keyboard  backlight brightness, volume, iTunes controls, dashboard controls,  Superdrive eject, and application viewer.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>(Superdrive is Apple's name  for DVD writer)It took some getting used to, the fact that Macs have 'command', 'option', and 'control' instead of 'Control' and 'Alt'The  keyboard has flat keys instead of concave "Chiclet-style" keys like  PCs.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This seems like a wash.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I don't really prefer one over the other.The  screen is glossy instead of matte.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>For those of you who like to point  to the screen and touch it, this will be a disappointment.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But maybe it  will teach you to either use the cursor or to "hover" instead of  touching!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I agree with Apple, that the screen appears clearer because of  this high gloss finish.The</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>packaging was very nice, and my Macbook  was shipped in two days by FedEx.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I can't tell it from new.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>There are no  scratches anywhere, and everything works perfectly.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It also has the  same warranty as a new Mac.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Good enough for me, when I'm saving $200!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Of  course the same instructions and hardware are included as well.This</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Macbook is thinner than an equivalent PC laptop, and with every edge  rounded.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Careful not to drop it!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This is not even the 'Air' version of  the Macbook either.The</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>touchpad is at least 3X bigger than any PC's  touchpad.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This, on its own, makes it much more easy to use and precise.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Add to this the fact that it has a matte glass surface and the whole pad  is a big click button and it is much better than a PCs.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Not only that,  but it is programmed so that it is actually as quick to use as a scroll  mouse.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>For example, swiping two fingers at a time causes the screen to  scroll, rather than just moving the cursor.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Swiping three fingers left  or right jumps back or ahead (respectively) a page.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Swiping four fingers  down shrinks each application so all open applications show on the  screen.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>To select a different one, just click on it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Swiping four  fingers up minimizes all applications off the screen.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Moving two fingers  apart zooms in, and pinching them together zooms out.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Rotating them  rotates images.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This seems like a lot to remember at first, but I found  that I learned it in about two days by heart, and I don't even miss a  mouse any more.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>(I always bring a mouse with my PC laptop for work  >:(The program (Apple calls them 'applications') package is also  very nice.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The Safari web browser is much faster than IE and a little  faster than Firefox.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The Top Sites feature is really neat; it remembers  the top 10 sites that I visit, and keeps them handy.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I find that I use  this more than I use the Favorites list.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Everything about it is just  smooth, and I haven't yet found a website that didn't look right or run  properly on it.Finder is the equivalent to Windows Explorer.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But  again, it is more well thought-out.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Things are easy to figure out.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The  default ways are much more rational than Windows Explorer.The mail program looks pretty slick, but I used web-based mail and choose not to use it.I  like that it comes with a nice chess program instead of a bunch of  crappy third party game demos.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>(I admit that I do miss solitaire from  time to time)iTunes is of course brilliant.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I liked it on PC, and I like it on Mac too.iPhoto  is OK for family picture type stuff.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It is geared more towards that and  helping one keep one's photos organized.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If you are a serious amateur  photographer, you'll probably want to buy another photo program.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I'm  using a demo of Pixelmator now, and I really like it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It will cost $60  to register when the demo runs out, but I think I'll do it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This is an  example of not as much freeware available for Mac as for PC.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I found  Irfanview for PC, which was fast, simple, and free.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I loved it and used  it for years.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I finally paid the $25 to register it and support Mr.  Irfan Skiljan.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>When I came to Mac, it didn't seem like there's an  equivalent freeware photo editing program.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The stuff that IS available  is as good or better than what is available for Windows, but it is just  not free.I have an old copy of MS Office that I'd been installing on  my PCs for years.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I'll need to go out and buy a copy for Mac.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>There is  OpenOffice and Neo Office available for free for Mac, but they can be  glitchy, I've read.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>(read NeoOffice's disclaimers about crashing; pretty  scary, considering they just asked for a donation)iChat is  brilliant.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It uses the Macbook Pro's built-in webcam.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The picture  quality is better than any PC webcam I've seen.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The video quality was  also better.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Not only that, but there don't seem to be any security  risks like there is for Skype for Windows.The Preview program is  really good too.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Basically, it allows you to see a useful preview of  images and popular other types of files (documents, PDFs, etc.) without  having to open another application.Other</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>deails that really impressed the engineer side of me:- The cooling fan is quiet, and is a blower style instead of a conventional fan style.-</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The power plug is magnetic.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It goes on and off easily and won't pull the computer on the floor if it is tripped over.-</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The headphone jack doubles as a microphone jack.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Just change it's function in a menu.-</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It has a built-in SD memory card slow.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>No messing around trying to find  the USB cable for your digital camera.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Just put the card in the Mac and  you're good to go.-</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The Superdrive doesn't use a tray.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Just put the  disc in the side.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The mechanism that takes the disc is much louder than  a tray type though.-</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>There are no dedicated ventilation openings.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The Macbook uses the opening for the monitor hinge for this.-</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>There are no dedicated openings for speakers.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>They are either under the  keyboard, or pointing out the hinge opening for the screen.-</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The openings for the microphone are tiny; they're right above the Escape key, but you have to look very closely to see them.-</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The aluminum enclosure doubles as a big heatsink, to help the cooling fan.??-  The computer doesn't need accessory cooling to work properly, unlike  some modern PC laptops.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Even when I have it sitting on a pillow, it  vents just fine and doesn't lock up or anything.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The only time I've  found it to get pretty warm is when it is charging and I'm using it at  the same time.-</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The screws that hold the bottom cover on go in at an angle, to make better use of space.I'm</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>sure I'll notice more nice little things as time goes by, and I'll post  the updates here.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But if you are frustrated with your PC and are ready  to buy a quality laptop, look no further.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Even if you buy a high-end  Windows laptop, you're still stuck running Windows, which is super slow  & clunky compared to Mac OS X (pronounced 'ten' not 'ex')</sentcont></sentence>

<sentence><sentcont>Some people complain about this but to me, it is just bright, clear and colors are outstanding.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>-Battery life averaging at most 5 hours.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Not bad but nowhere near  the 7 hours advertised.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Not a con bc the battery life is still excellent -Bootup speed is superb.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>20 seconds to boot up and less than 5 seconds to shut it down.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>-Snow Leopard is fast and expose makes life easier.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>cons: -First of all, this is the bottom of the line macbook pro.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If you  wanna do any serious "professional" work here, you won't be happy.</sentcont></sentence>

<sentence><sentcont>-Snow Leopard is far from being stable.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Plenty of compatibility issues, especially with Adobe products.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>-Safari is a memory hog -Heating issues.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Aliminum dissipates heat better, so I wonder how those white macbooks handle the heat issue.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>-Why on earth would the team design for the macbook pro line-up  design a vent dissipating heat towards the screen.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>That WILL cause the  premature failure.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>-USB ports are TOo CLOSE TOGETHER.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If you use a non-bluetooth  mouse(which is recommended for a longer battery life) and want to use a  flashdrive, you have to choose for one or the other.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>-Minidisplay port.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Really Apple?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It doesn't even support audio at  the moment so why replace the mini-dvi display?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Or why not go the HDMI  option?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>-Glossy screen.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Not a fan but if you adjust the brightness properly, it should be just fine.</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>I originally owned a 13" 2.16 black Macbook and for almost two years and it served me well.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I'm an Integrated Marketing & Communications student (which is just a fancy name for mixed media advertising) and our course requires us to work in a Maclab to use the various applications essential for creating rich media (e.g. Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator, GarageBand, iDVD, iMovie, Final Cut Express, Word, etc.) Macbook (Pro) is apparently the "industry standard" for media types so it was only fitting that I buy one.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>When it came time to purchase, like a good student, I did my homework and found that although Macbook is a great computer, it is more expensive than its Windows based peers.</sentcont></sentence>

<sentence><sentcont>I could get the same power as a Macbook for half the price.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Why would I want to buy a Macbook? 3 reasons:1) That is what I'm learning on.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Use an Apple (iMac) at school, might as well use a  Apple Macbook at home.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>2) That is what the big-wheels use and is the "industry standard".</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>My teachers kept reminding us that when it comes to working with photography, video and  media, Apple was the way to.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Take a look around the Internet and look at what many of the pro's are using.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>They use Macbook Pro's!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Big surprise.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>3) Individuality.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Now, several of my classmates also felt they needed to buy a Macbook for the first 2 reasons and they did.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So I made sure to buy the black Macbook which performed a little better and had a Superdrive, meaning I  finished burning my videos quicker then my classmates using the iMac's DVD burner!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So although a dozen people in my class also had a Macbook, we were  still a minority on campus, which to me, is great because when it comes to  being a business student, it's nice to stand out from all the other suits.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So! What about the new 13" Macbook Pro?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>All we've heard are stories about this old black Macbook.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Who cares?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Patience, good reviewees, it has relevance.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>When it came time to actually purchase the laptop it was tough because I was living off of student loans and buying a laptop was going to take a chunk of my budget.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I looked around for used and found an older 15" Macbook Pro for a decent price.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>However it was an older processor (Intel Core Duo, which had a tendency to get hot) and the coating from the keyboard edge had flaked off.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Despite these minor shortcomings I was very close to buying it because it had the "Pro" status and the seller, sensing my hesitation, was even going to throw in a 500 MB external drive to sweeten the deal!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>At the end of the day, after much deliberation I made the decision to buy the new 13" black Macbook.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It cost a little more then the used Macbook Pro but it had the new Intel Core 2 Duo and wasn't very far off the performance of the older Pro model.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>For just over a year and a half, that black Macbook served me well.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>After a few hardware problems that seemed to just be a result of a "bad Apple", I was given a replacement.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Luckily, for me, that occurred on June 5th, 2009 - the day the new Macbook Pro's came out.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Because my black Macbook was more expensive and powerful then the white ones, I was given the brand new 13" 2.26GHz Macbook Pro which is comparitive in price and overall specs e.g. same size screen and 160 GB hard drive but has an extra GB of RAM, the SD card slot, aluminum unibody, glass screen, Nvidia GeForce 9400M graphics, etc.So I've walked that fine line between the high end Macbook and the low end Macbook Pro.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I was a little sorry to see my old black Macbook go.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>As I said earlier and despite its hardware issues, it served me well.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Call me sentimental.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Despite the obvious upgrade I was a little hesitant about the new Macbook Pro.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Will I like the aluminum look?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The glossy screen?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>(as opposed to the matte screen on my black Macbook), the closed battery concept, the keyboard...Well here it is.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I have been using computers since the Vic-20 (yes I'm 32 years old).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I have used Microsoft products for a long time (Dos shell anyone?).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>After many years of happily using Windows on various desktops, I was willing to try something new.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>My old black Macbook and subsequently my current Macbook Pro with Leopard OS is amazing.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>My brother, who is a die-hard PC user and lover of Windows still looks at my computer with envy (if not a little fear, which is the biggest reason most people don't switch to a Mac, they don't know the Leopard experience).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>When my brother uses my laptop, he loves it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The chiclet, backlit keyboard, the vibrant colours of my glossy screen, its loading speed and the sheer beauty of the aluminum body.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>My black Macbook chipped on the right side of the trackpad near the edge just from resting my hand on it and I noticed (because I looked) on my classmates Macbooks that this wasn't an isolated incident.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>All in all, the new Macbook Pro is a work of art that performs, like a Porsche or Mercedes.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It has amazing resale value and every good thing said about it is 100% true.</sentcont></sentence>

<reviewtitle>Adds SD card slot and reacquires FireWire; lower starting price</reviewtitle>
<rating>0.8</rating>
<freereview><sentence><sentcont>Most notable, the 13-inch aluminum unibody MacBook has been promoted to join the MacBook Pro family.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's a move that makes sense, as the differences between the two lines were becoming increasingly blurred.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>To complete the transformation, the 13-inch Pro regains its missing FireWire port, making it even more useful for creative professionals on the go.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>New to the Pro line is something we never thought we'd see on a MacBook: an SD card slot.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Standard on the 13- and 15-inch Pro laptops, this corrects one of our main MacBook annoyances.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>We're also pleased to see the backlit keyboard--previously found in only the more expensive 13-inch versions--filter down to even the $1,149 base model (which is a nice discount from the previous $1,299 entry price).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Some have strong feelings about the nonremovable battery--similar to those already found on the MacBook Air and 17-inch Pro.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's a legitimate concern, but we think the promise of better battery life (Apple claims up to a 40 percent improvement), and three times as many recharge cycles as older batteries is just as important.</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>The MacBook Pro is a line of??Macintosh portable computer introduced in January 2006 by??Apple inc.??The MacBook Pro replaced the PowerBook G and was the second model to be announced in the Apple-Intel transition (after the iMac).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The MacBook Pro is positioned at the high end of the MacBook family.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>There are currently three MacBook Pro models: the 13-, 15-, and 17- inch.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>There have been two designs for the MacBook Pro, both using aluminum.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The first design was largely a carry-over from the PowerBook G4 and utilized the Intel Core central processing units as opposed to the PowerPC G4 chips used in the model it replaced.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It was first released as a 15-inch model in January 2006, followed by a 17-inch model in April of the same year.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>These original models received several updates and were upgraded with Core 2 Duo processors in late 2006.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The second "unibody" model has a more tapered design with most of the casing made from a single block of aluminum.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This design was introduced with the 15-inch MacBook Pro in October 2008, along with the 13-inch aluminum unibody MacBook.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The 17-inch model was updated with the same design the following January, also introducing the built-in battery that was later used in the rest of the MacBook Pro line from June and in the regular MacBookfrom October 2009.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Apple updated the unibody line in April 2010 with Intel Core i5 and Core i7 processors in the 15- and 17-inch models, while the 13-inch models retained the Core 2 Duo processors.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The original 15-inch MacBook Pro was announced on January 10, 2006 by Steve Jobs at the Macworld Conference & Expo.[1]</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The 17-inch model was later unveiled on April 24, 2006.[2]The first design was largely a carryover from the PowerBook G4 and utilized Intel Core CPUs as opposed to the PowerPC G4 chips used by its predecessor[3].</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It is 0.1??inches (0.25??cm) deeper, 0.4??inches (1.0??cm) wider, and 0.1??inches (0.25??cm) thinner than the 15-inch aluminum PowerBook G4, while weighing the same.[4]Other</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>changes from the PowerBook include a built-in iSight webcam and the inclusion of MagSafe, a magnetic power connector designed to detach easily when pulled to prevent the entire laptop from being pulled off a surface.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Both features were later brought over to the MacBook.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In order to accommodate the slimmer form factor of the MacBook Pro, the speed of the optical drive was halved compared to that of the PowerBook G4 and dual layer DVD writing support was omitted.[3][5]</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Both the original 15- and 17-inch discrete model MacBook Pros come with ExpressCard/34 slots, which replace the PC Card slots found in the PowerBook G4.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>All discrete 15-inch models have two USB 2.0 ports and one FireWire 400 port,[6]while the 17-inch models have three USB 2.0 ports as well as one FireWire 400 port.[7]When</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>first introduced, the MacBook Pro did not come with FireWire 800 or S-Video ports,[6][4]although FireWire 800 was added in the next 15-inch model revision[8] and was present in every version of the 17-inch design.[7]S-Video</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>capability can be attained through the use of a DVI to S-Video adapter.[4]</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>External displays with up to a 2560??????1600 pixel resolution) are supported through a dual-link DVI port.[9]</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>All models include a built-in Gigabit Ethernet port, Bluetooth 2.0, and 802.11a/b/g.[6][7]</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Later models include support for the draft 2.0 specification of 802.11n[10] and Bluetooth 2.1.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Apple refreshed the entire MacBook Pro line on October 24, 2006, to include Intel Core 2 Duo processors.[8]</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Memory capacity was doubled for each model, to 1??GB on the low-end 15-inch and 2??GB for the high-end 15- and 17-inch models.[8]</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>FireWire 800 was added to the 15-inch models.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Hard drive capacity was increased, although video card options stayed the same.[8]The</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>MacBook Pro line received a second update on June 5, 2007 with new nVidia Geforce 8600M GT video cards and faster processor options.[11][12]</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>LED backlighting was added to the 15-inch model's screen, and its weight was reduced from 5.6??pounds (2.5??kg) to 5.4??pounds (2.4??kg).[12]</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Furthermore, the speed of the front-side buswas increased from 667??MHz to 800??MHz.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>On November 1, 2007, Apple added the option of a 2.6??GHz Santa Rosa platform Core 2 Duo CPU as well as reconfigured hard drive options.[12]On</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>February 26, 2008, the MacBook Pro line was again updated.[13][14]</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>LED backlighting was added as an option for the 17-inch model.[13]</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Processors were updated to "Penryn" cores, which are built on the 45 nanometer process (65 nanometer "Merom" cores were previously used), and hard drive and memory capacities were increased.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>[13]Multi-touch capabilities, first introduced with the MacBook Airearlier that year, were brought over the MacBook Pro's trackpad.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>[13]At the time of the introduction of the 15-inch unibody MacBook Pro on October 14, 2008, the discrete model with the same screen size was discontinued, while the 17-inch discrete model continued to be sold.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>[15]The.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>discrete model was discontinued on January 6, 2009, when the 17-inch MacBook Pro was also updated with unibody construction.[16]</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Upon release, reviewers noted the speed increase of the MacBook Pro when compared to the PowerBook G4 as well as the improved wireless performance.[3]Reviewers were impressed with the performance increase offered by the 15-inch MacBook Pro over the PowerBook G4.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>At times, two- or three-fold improvements in performance were seen; for example, the 3D rendering program Cinema 4D XL was 3.3??times faster[ and the boot-up time was more than halved.The</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>MacBook Pro generally performs better on performance analyzer utility tests, XBench and Cinebench, over the PowerBook G4.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Although a few horizontal pixels were lost (1440.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>900 in the MacBook Pro instead of 1440.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>960 in the PowerBook), the screen quality was noted as "nothing less than stellar" by one reviewer, with bright, crisp, and true colors.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>maximum screen brightness was increased by 67??percent over the PowerBook G4, something that reviewers lauded along with the excellent horizontal viewing angles and the matte options.The</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>battery was found to last around 3.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>5.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>hours per charge, similar to the PowerBook it replaced, and reviewers praised the functionality of the MagSafe power adapter introduced along with the MacBook Pro.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The backlit keyboard and large trackpad received positive reviews as well, as was the virtually silent operation of the machine.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Reviewers commented on the notebook's overall performance but were critical of the decision to underclock the ATI Mobility Radeon X1600 graphics card by about 30??percent its original speed.The notebook was also noted for producing significant heat.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Complaints included the increasing difficulty of upgrading system memory as compared to older Apple notebooks.Since the dimensions for the 15-inch MacBook Pro were tweaked slightly from the 15-inch PowerBook G4, accessories such as notebook sleeves were not interchangeable between the two models.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Also, a slight flickering was also mentioned when the screen was on lower brightness settings.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>), the battery life averaged at slightly over three hours, about the same as the PowerBook G4.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>[ This was attributed to the more powerful Core Duo CPU.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Reviewers were hoping for around an hour more of battery life, but noted that battery life was already about on par or better than competition.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Although the addition of the MagSafe charging port was praised for saving notebooks from falling to the floor when the power cord is tripped over, it was found to disconnect too easily in some instances, leading to irritation for one reviewer.</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>I have used Mac computers ever since I was a little kid.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The first computer in my house was an old Power PC running Mac OS 6.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I never stopped loving Apple products, and now, 18 years, 5 power PCs, 3 different OS's, 2 ipod videos, an ipod touch, and a new Macbook Pro 13" later, I am still in love with Apple.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The laptop is top notch compared to anything I have ever owned.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The processor is amazingly fast, and the resolution on the screen is light years ahead of the old CRT monitors I used with my Power PCs.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I have thouroughly enjoyed the shortcuts on the trackpad, and find that it makes switching between applications SO much easier!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The built in bluetooth makes it easy to stay wireless with my bluetooth mouse for graphics work in Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop, which this notebook runs with flying colors, and no errors or glitches.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The newer Operating System is a big plus.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I had gotten so used to OS 9.2 that I thought that was the only way it was.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>When I discovered Snow Leopard on my new MacBook, I instantly fell in love.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It is so much easier to use, and the dock is an amazing touch.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It is hard for me to find a downside to this computer, beside the price, but if you are like me, you were in for an upgrade anyway.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The only other downside that I experienced is that the computer sometimes gets very hot, but this can be easily fixed by downloading a free fan speed control software, and lowering the screen and keyboard brightness.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>?? overall, the MacBook Pro is the best computer I have ever owned.</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>At first glance, you may not notice anything different about Apple???s latest line of MacBook Pros, introduced in April 2010.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The new models, which feature 13-, 15- and 17-inch screens, sport the same sleek, minimalist design, the same keyboard, and the same touch pad as the previous iteration.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Even the ports haven???t changed.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>To tell the difference, you really have to get down and dirty and actually start using one of these new members of the MacBook Pro family.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Once you do, you.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>?ll see advancements in performance in a line of laptops that was already well ahead of much of its market, and battery life that blows the competition out of the park.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>We got our hands on an entry-level $1,199 MacBook Pro, built around a 2.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>4GHz Intel Core 2 Duo processor, a 250GB hard drive, and a 13-inch screen.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This is the base model of the group.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>For $200 more, you can bump up your processor to 2.66GHz and your hard drive to 320GB.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The 15-inch models start at $1,799, and the 17-inchers at $2,199.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The 15-inch and 17-inch models now come standard with Core i5 processors (you can upgrade to Core i7) and advanced switchable graphics technology.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The 13-inch offers only Core 2 Duo CPUs and integrated Nvidia GeForce 320M graphics in both its models.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Take note: With this generation of MacBook Pros, the base price of the 15-inch model has increased by $100; the 17-inch base price has decreased by $200; and the 13-inch base price stays the same.On the outside, the 13-inch MacBook Pro is almost exactly the same as the previous version.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Design-wise, we think Apple was smart to approach the new line with the attitude that if it???s not broken, don???t fix it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The previous line of MacBook Pros was as stunning as it was stark, and the new line carries that torch onward.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The silver case, dominated by an aluminum shell with just one seam around the underside, feels plenty solid.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Nothing much mars the design of the MacBook???s body: On the top of the lid is a simple white Apple logo that lights up when the laptop is in use.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>And, well, that???s about it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The case snaps shut with a magnetic latch, making opening the lid easy without compromising the durability of the body.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Like the previous version, the ports are located on the left side of the chassis and include an Ethernet jack, a FireWire 800 port (backward-compatible with FireWire 400, 200, and 100), a mini-DisplayPort connector (for attaching an external display), two USB 2.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>0 ports, an SD-card slot, and a headphone jack.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Toward the front left of the chassis are indicator lights that allow for a quick look at remaining battery power.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>On the right side of the body are a security-lock slot and the opening for the slot-loading optical drive, which is a dual-layer DVD burner.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>As with previous MacBook lines, it doesn???t support Blu-ray discs.Once</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>you open the lid, you???ll also notice that little has changed in the design of the keyboard and touch pad (which Apple terms its "trackpad").</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The full-size keyboard comes with backlit keys, and it remains perfectly spaced and nicely responsive to the touch.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>An ambient-light sensor adjusts the key backlighting according to the brightness of the area where you???re working.On the keyboard deck is the generously sized, buttonless multi-touch trackpad, which has a glass surface.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Instead of the two-button pad you???ll find on most other laptops, the entire pad on the MacBook Pro acts as a button, allowing you to press anywhere to enact a function; you use two fingers to right-click.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>One new feature related to it is that if you swipe up or down on the pad with two fingers, you???ll continue to scroll through the page until it reaches the top or bottom, just as an iPad or iPhone works.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>We appreciate these touches that Apple keeps adding to further bridge its products together.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>We also discovered that you can even toggle in and out of full-screen mode when watching a DVD by pinching and pulling on the touch pad, a nice enhancement.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>We found the trackpad very easy to get used to, especially since it functions much like the touch screen on an iPad or iPhone.As with previous MacBook Pros, the pad also allows you to use a four-finger swipe to show your desktop, view all open windows, or change programs.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Of course, the now-requisite multi-touch functionality is built in here as well.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>(This is the same as the touch features on an Apple iPhone or iPad, allowing you to zoom, rotate, and slide images around with two fingers.)The</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>13-inch glossy screen on the model we tested has a native resolution of 1,280x800 and is not upgradable.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Graphic designers who require a higher-resolution screen might want to look at upgrading to the 17-inch model, which comes standard with a resolution of 1,920x1,200.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>We found the 13-inch base model???s screen displays movies and photos with vivid, accurate colors.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Artists also take note: Although the option of an antiglare screen is available in the 15- and 17-inch models, it's not offered for the 13-inch screen.If</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>you bought the previous version of the 13-inch MacBook Pro and are happy with what you have, we say stick with it, as this round has seen only minor changes for this screen size.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If you're looking to go to a larger model, however, huge improvements in CPU and graphics performance in the 15- and 17-inch models make them attractive upgrade options, so long as you're willing to pay a premium for them.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If you didn't upgrade last time, however, the latest iteration of the 13-inch MacBook Pro is solidly ahead of the laptop pack in both design and performance, and it comes at an affordable price, for a MacBook.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>We applaud the unprecedented battery life in the new line of MacBook Pros.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Apple has once again taken what was already an impressive machine and made it even better.</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>?? Although the MacBook and MacBook Pro line was initially relaunched last fall with the 17-inch version intact, it was recently revamped to sport the same sleek, unibody construction as its 13- and 15-inch siblings.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Although it shares their design and the 15-inch Pro's switchable?? it's different in two key ways: its nonremovable battery promises up to 8 hours on a charge, and its display has a 60 percent increase in the 15-inch Pro's color gamut.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's also the thinnest and lightest 17-inch laptop on the planet.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Starting at a hefty $2,799, the 17-inch MacBook Pro is not for everyone, but for creative professionals who can afford it, this machine is close to perfect.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Lightweight Design If you're inclined to avoid a 17-inch notebook because you think it will be less portable than a notebook with a smaller screen, think again.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>At 6.6 pounds and 0.98 inches thick, the 17-inch MacBook Pro is the world's thinnest and lightest notebook with that size display.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In fact, this system is only slightly heavier than the typical 15.4-inch laptop, and plenty of 16-inch models weigh more.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>??The unibody chassis is cut from a single piece of metal; you won't find any seams or doors, not even for the battery.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In addition to making for an eye-catching design, the unibody construction enhances the notebook's durability.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Rather than a latch enclosure, the lid keeps shut with an internal magnet.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The notebook felt sturdy as we carried it from room to room.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Keyboard Before the recent redesign, the old 17-inch MacBook Pro had a keyboard layout that felt larger than the 15-inch version's; a bigger footprint meant bigger keys.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>For some, the 17-inch model's keys were, in fact, too large.??</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The latest MacBook Pros have island keyboards, whose low-profile, Chiclet keys sit in the center of the keyboard deck, flanked by diminutive speaker strips.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Like the other recently announced MacBooks, these take after the original?? contrasting black keys against an aluminum body.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>While the keys themselves seem the same size, you might find yourself craning over a wider palm rest.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>As an added touch, the keyboard is backlit in low light, thanks to an ambient light sensor.</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>As a student, Writer and avid music listener, I spend lots of time on the go and on my computer.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So when my Dell Inspiron 1525 died(which i hated btw), I decided to spend the money for a better laptop.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>My first choice was the regular MacBook but my cousin who has had 2 MacBooks, suggested the MacBook Pro.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Well working part-time, it took me about a month to save up but man was it worth it!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I purchased mine refurbished through the Apple Store, which I highly recommend.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Two days later my MacBook Pro 13" laptop arrived.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It comes in a non-chalant brown box, but once opened reveals a small black box with the MacBook Pro on the front.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Opening the box was like your first time in love, a very giddy moment for me.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Opening it reveals the basic items in any laptop, the charger/cords/software/cleaning cloth, oh I almost forgot about the actual MacBook which is wrapped in a black cloth, very simple yet elegant.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Turning it on and plugging it in was easy and after a bright and musical opening screen, a number of screens show up asking for your basic info.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>and asking for a MobileMe account, which is optional.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Once started up, everything ran flawlessly and all programs ran smoothly from the moment I turned it on, no lag whatsoever.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>After downloading all my favorite programs and changing the Background of course I was not disappointed at all.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I didn't run any tests on performance except for startup and shutdown tests.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Mine starts up in under 10 seconds and shuts down in just over 5 seconds.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Much better than the almost 2 minutes for my old Dell computer.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Unlike Windows computers, when the desktop shows up, you can get right to work with no delay and nothing pops up unless you allow it to.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>My personal favorite things have to be the 7 hour battery life(which I tested) and the Itunes integrated keys.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The battery under normal usage lasts me between 5 1/2 hours and up to 7 hours, much better than 2 hours out of my Dell.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Most people would say they love the lightweight or backlit keys best, but personally, as a multi-tasker and music listener, I love the Itunes integrated keys.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Pressing play automatically opens Itunes if it's not up and no matter if Itunes is minimized or not, your music will pause or play.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The Dashboard key is also a nice touch, allowing you to access apps like a calendar or Facebook without interrupting your work.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>There really no cons about the computer except the screen attracts dust like a magnet and smugges are surprisingly hard to get off even with the cloth they supply.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>For travelers, students, writers, or anyone that uses their computer a lot or just wants a long-lasting computer I highly recommend the MacBook Pro 13".</sentcont></sentence>

<pro><sentence>
<sentcont> Beautiful unibody construction, good backlit keyboard, light weight, fast, stylish design, excellent support </sentcont>
</sentence></pro>
<con><sentence>
<sentcont> Very high price tag, lacking in features found in similarly priced laptops including firewire 400, expresscard slot, incompatible with a lot of hardware, proprietary OS, annoying trackpad, no matte screen option</sentcont>
<sentcont>no bluray option</sentcont>
</sentence></con>
<freereview><sentence><sentcont>The new 13 inch Macbook Pro is a great improvement over the previous generation 13 inch Macbook Pro but is still vastly inferrior to it's similarly priced PC counterparts.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It is very sexy and stylish and is running the proprietary Macintosh OS which some may consider an upside and others will consider a downside.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The upside being that if you've been frustrated with Windows Vista but don't want an antiquated PC running XP(but more importantly, you didn't like XP) then this may be a great option for you.If however style is not as important as function and you've enjoyed using XP or like Vista then a similarly priced ThinkPad will provide you with a better experience having better performance, better build quality and more features for about the same price from a company rated to have support almost as good as Apple's (Consumer reports rates Apple #1 in customer support, Lenovo #2).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Consider checking out the Lenovo T400 ThinkPad.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Play with both, talk to a sales rep about life expectancy of the battery and the machine it's self.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Do not go to an Apple Store.</sentcont></sentence>

<sentence><sentcont>Expand full review Radically overhauled last year, Apple's MacBook line of laptops moved to aluminum construction, edge-to-edge glass over LED displays, and oversize multitouch trackpads (with the exception of the lone $999 white plastic model).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The latest round of updates is more of a refinement than another revolution, but it adds some much-sought-after features, while lowering prices on many configurations.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Most notable, the 13-inch aluminum unibody MacBook has been promoted to join the MacBook Pro family.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's a move that makes sense, as the differences between the two lines were becoming increasingly blurred.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>To complete the transformation, the 13-inch Pro regains its missing FireWire port, making it even more useful for creative professionals on the go.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>New to the Pro line is something we never thought we'd see on a MacBook: an SD card slot.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Standard on the 13- and 15-inch Pro laptops, this corrects one of our main MacBook annoyances.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>We're also pleased to see the backlit keyboard--previously found in only the more expensive 13-inch versions--filter down to even the $1,149 base model (which is a nice discount from the previous $1,299 entry price).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Some have strong feelings about the nonremovable battery--similar to those already found on the MacBook Air and 17-inch Pro.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's a legitimate concern, but we think the promise of better battery life (Apple claims up to a 40 percent improvement), and three times as many recharge cycles as older batteries is just as important.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>There are still a few items on our 13-inch wish list--matte screens, mobile broadband options, Blu-ray--but Apple has done an admirable job filling in some of the major missing pieces.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>By offering more features for less money, the 13-inch MacBook Pro remains one of the most universally useful laptops available.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The design and construction of the system remain largely the same as last year's model, with a solid block of aluminum carved down, rather than a thin outer shell that has had support struts added to it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's both lighter and sturdier than the older plastic versions of the 13-inch MacBook.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The new Pro also retains the same oversize trackpad, where the entire surface depresses like a button--although a simple tapping (as on a PC laptop) will also work once you turn that option on in the settings menu.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>We've become accustomed to the two-, three-, and four-finger multitouch gestures, which let you hide all your apps by sweeping four fingers up on the pad, or bring up the application switcher by sweeping four fingers left or right.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Once you get used to that, going back to a regular touch pad is difficult.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>According to Apple, the new display offers a wider color gamut, and the screen certainly looks bright and colorful, but we wish the same matte-screen option offered on the 17-inch MacBook Pro was available across the line.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The 13.3-inch wide-screen LCD offers a 1,280x800-pixel native resolution, which is standard for screens this size, but we'd love to see Apple try its hand at a 16:9 laptop display.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>While the LED screen means a thinner lid and some battery life benefits, the edge-to-edge glass covering the entire display panel grabs stray light rays with ease, making the glossy screen hard to see in some lighting conditions.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>By bringing back the FireWire port (now FireWire 800) and adding an SD card slot, Apple has addressed most of our most pressing issues with the previous 13-inch model.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Pro photographers will point out that they usually use CompactFlash cards, but the rest of us won't have to always remember to pack a USB card reader or cable to directly connect our cameras.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Connecting to another video display, however, will require a sold-separately dongle for the Mini-DisplayPort video output.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The 13-inch MacBook Pro performed as expected in our benchmark tests, with the 2.26GHz GHz Intel Core 2 Duo CPU roughly on par with the 2.4GHz processor in the late-2008 version of the 13-inch MacBook.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Trading up to the faster 2.8GHz Core 2 Duo available in the 15-inch MacBook Pro yields a marked improvement on paper, but for most anecdotal use--Web surfing, working on office documents, multimedia playback--any of the current MacBooks will be more than adequate.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>An even faster 3.08GHz CPU is available on the 15-inch MacBook Pro, but the 13-inch model tops out at 2.53GHz.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The fact is this review is useless, all the reviews a pretty much  useless, because only two types of people read them, mac users or soon  to be mac users that want a new computer are looking for a excuse to buy  one, or windows users that feel for what ever reason apple has no  business makeing things and this some how hurts them, and the only way  to heal such a pain is with fire, flamebait filled fire.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>All in all my  word don't mean much, but if think you'll enjoy owning and using the  computer, then go ahead and get one, there nice machines that run well  and are extremely well built, but i won't lie to you and tell you that  there cheap, there not, and i won't tell you that your getting hardware  you can't get from another company, because you can, but when it all  boils down to it, the whole is more then the sum of its parts and by  purchasing a mac, your getting an experience you can't get else where  and in my opinion no dell or hp will match it.</sentcont></sentence>

<reviewtitle>Switched from Windows: More good than bad. Great hardware</reviewtitle>
<rating>0.8</rating>
<pro><sentence>
<sentcont> it just rocks </sentcont>
</sentence></pro>
<freereview><sentence><sentcont>This is my first Mac computer.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>My first four computers ran Win 3.1, Windows 95, XP, and Vista (from about 1995-present).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I have quite a lot of time spent on each of them.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Switching from Windows to Mac is not difficult, but it can be a bit frustrating for a week or so.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>There are Windows features that you will miss, but they are mostly overcome by overall advantages in my opinion.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I've spent two weeks with this machine now.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If I had written this review after one day, I would have probably stated that I regretted the switch to Mac.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>After getting more proficient with the machine and realizing how well it works, I would definitely recommend it to a friend.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This review is going to be a mix of my impressions of both the hardware and the Mac operating system from a new Mac user perspective.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The only difference between my machine and the one on this product page is that I ordered directly from Apple and upgraded the hard drive to 250GB (from the 160GB base option).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I am using 2gb of ram and the lower-end processor.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>My Mac OS impressions: The biggest thing I missed from Windows at first was the task bar.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Mac uses the "dock" to replace the task bar.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The dock is kind of like the quick launch toolbar in Windows spread out across the entire bar, with large icons.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Having used windows with a task bar for the past 13 years, I missed the ability to see all open programs and switch between them with the task bar.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The dock has a tiny dot below the icon on running-programs, but nothing else to separate it from other program and folder icons.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The dock is not nearly as useful for multitasking as the task bar.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The saving grace that rescues the Mac from awkward app-switching while multitasking is called expose.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Expose is activated by either pressing a key or using a multitouch gesture (four-finger swipe).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Expose uses the entire screen to display all open windows and allow you to switch between them.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's like alt+tab on steroids.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Having used the machine for a couple weeks, I miss using expose when I use my Windows machine.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>As much as I hated the dock at first, I have to give the advantage to the Mac for managing multiple windows while multitasking.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The controls for open-windows are quite different than in MS-Windows.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In Mac, there is a resize, hide, and minimize button instead of maximize, minimize, restore, and close.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>To close an app on the mac you need to use a menu command or keyboard shortcut.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The Mac resize button kind of works like restore/maximize, only it's a bit more awkward.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>A commenter here pointed out that it resizes the window for ideal viewing without using the entire screen.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I find myself resizing windows by dragging corners more than I ever did on a Windows machine.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I really miss the ability to maximize, if for no other reason but to avoid distractions.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The green resize button may be better on an enormous monitor, but not on a 13" notebook.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>When you minimize or hide an app on the Mac, it is only available from the dock and is hidden from expose.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I'll give the window size-management advantage to Windows in this contest.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The windows system is just easier and more logical in my opinion.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It isn't a deal-breaker, but I do miss the Windows "window controls."</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If you are a frequent user of the F11 key while web browsing in Windows you'll have to kiss that feature goodbye.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Neither Firefox nor Safari will go full-screen.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Windows Explorer is "replaced" with an app called Finder.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Finder is kind of like the start menu and an explorer window all rolled up into one.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Compared with older versions of Windows, finder is adequate but Vista's explorer is quite a bit easier and more logical to use.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I prefer Vista's preview pane to Mac's coverflow.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I miss the "up folder" button.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I have found myself mostly using the view that puts files, folders and apps into a column view for easiest computer browsing, and it just isn't as elegant as Windows Vista.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The lack of a maximize button has caused frustration especially in the finder, because the finder likes to stay in a very small window unless you drag the corners.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The Safari web browser is nice and quick and has a decent security reputation.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I have been switching back and forth between Safari and Firefox.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Firefox has crashed a couple of times and I really like being able to use multitouch gestures with Safari, so I'm leaning toward making Safari my main web tool.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Reading RSS feeds, and the bookmark toolbar are really well done in Safari.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Browsers are so personal that it's difficult to recommend one over the other, but as a Firefox user in Windows I think I have high standard and Safari has met or exceeded them.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I absolutely hate the iPhoto app.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Iphoto does not allow you to organize and browse your photos in folders.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It imports your pictures and sorts them itself based on time/date stamps on the photos.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This works fine for personal vacation snapshots but it completely mixed up the rest of my images.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Folders that were neatly organized for work projects, and fun web clippings, and adult stuff were all shuffled into one big mess after I imported my image collection.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I ended up just deleting all of them and not using iphoto at all.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Right now I'm just using Finder to browse my photos and the preview app to view them.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Light editing work isn't possible in the preview app and I still haven't decided what to use for a basic photo editor yet.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Vista's photo app is junk but it's still superior to iPhoto if you like to keep your photos organized using your own folder system.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I know people who love iphoto.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It comes down to whether you want the ability to organize your collection yourself.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If you have a big mess of photos, you'll love iphoto's ability to organize them via event and face recognition.Edited</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>to add: you can organize your photos into "albums" after you import them into iPhoto, but be prepared to spend a lot of time reorganizing everything.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Even after you organize into albums, the main library screen gives you views of your entire collection (perhaps things you don't want everyone to see).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I have not used Garage Band or iMovie yet.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I'll update later when I get a chance.Edited to add: I played with garage band a bit and it's pretty powerful.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It allows you to import and export AAC and MP3 tracks and record sound in multiple tracks.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Very easy to use.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The only other audio app i've ever used is audacity and I much prefer Garage Band.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I haven't used any of the music lessons it offers yet but plan to soon.I played with iMovie for a few minutes and it seems pretty nice and very intuitive.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I actually don't mind Windows Movie Maker, which is included with Vista.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I would not consider it a big step up from Win Movie Maker, but it's a nice app.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The mail, calendar, and address book apps are basic but work very very well.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The address app will import common file types easily.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It will sync with yahoo out of the box.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Address book will only sync with Google contacts if you own an iPhone or iPod Touch.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Everyone has an opinion about iTunes.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I'm a big fan of it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's exactly like the windows version only it runs a bit faster without the bugs.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If you have an iPhone or iPod touch, the Windows-iTunes bug with time/date being wrong after the computer sleeps is not an issue on the Mac.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Time machine is the Mac's backup app.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It is amazing and very simple.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I'm using an external drive plugged into my Apple Airport wireless router, as a backup disk.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>My wireless disk showed up on my desktop instantly once I plugged it into the router.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Time machine noticed the external drive right away and went to work backing up my files (after asking permission of course).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Now my machine automatically backs up any changes every hour as long as I'm in range of my wireless access point.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Time machine is a big load off my mind.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If I ever have a drive failure or my computer is destroyed I have an exact backup of everything without remembering to backup my files.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Vista will backup according to a set schedule, but it lacks the ability to easily look through backups for specific files.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Time machine is wonderful and make wireless backup effortless.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The Mac disk utility is almost as good as the one in Vista and it's easier to use.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's far superior to the one in XP.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I used it to format my external wireless drive because the Mac router couldn't read NTFS formating (although the computer can read NTFS drives via USB for some reason).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The graphics control software is a joy to use.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>When I plug in my external monitor it immediately extends my desktop to the new monitor.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Adjusting everything from resolution to rotation couldn't be any easier.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Boot camp is a utility that allows you to create a partition and install Windows as a secondary boot system (you need to own or buy a legal single-disk 32bit copy of either Windows XP or Windows Vista).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>When you start up the boot camp utility, it gives you a choice between using either 5 or 32 GB of space for the Windows partition.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I learned the hard way that Windows XP SP3 won't fit into 5GB.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>You need to give it at least the 32 GB (which left me with almost exactly 200GB on my "250" GB drive).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Installing Windows using the Boot Camp utility is very very easy.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Once you get Windows loaded, your OSX install disk makes quick work of installing drivers for all of your laptop's hardware.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's too bad that Nvidia and HP aren't as good at putting together easy Windows driver packages as Apple.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In order to boot into Windows, you simply press the "option" key during bootup and it allows you to choose which OS to run.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Windows XP absolutely screams on this hardware.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The hardware: The hardware is where this computer really shines.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The biggest advantage is stability.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>My last computer purchase was a vista machine.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>To say that I had stability and hardware compatibility issues with my HP Vista desktop is an understatement.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The main reason I turned to mac for this purchase was the fact that the hardware, drivers, and software are made for each other.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This machine has ran flawlessly for the past two weeks.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I did have two crashes of the Firefox browser while watching Flash video, but only the browser went down rather than the entire system.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I have connected an external monitor, camera, ipod, USB drive, and router to this machine.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>All of the drivers were already installed and everything has "just worked."</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The hardware is a joy to use when it just works.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It is difficult to put into words how happy I am with the lack of effort in using this machine.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The speed isn't blazing-fast but it runs very well, even with many many apps and windows running.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>My Vista desktop has similar specs, but my new Mac feels slightly faster.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>One outstanding productivity feature of this machine is the touch pad.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I honestly prefer it to using a mouse for office and browsing tasks.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I can't say enough good things about the multitouch gestures.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Two finger scrolling, two finger right-click, three finger forward and back in Safari, and four finger expose make this machine feel like like it is part of you.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Having the entire surface of the touchpad as the button is brilliant, especially for drag and drop operations.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The large size of the touchpad makes it very precise.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The keyboard is really nice.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>At first I thought the keys were a bit soft and the travel was too shallow, but I quickly got used to it and now prefer it to my more "clicky" desktop keyboard.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I don't know how I lived this long without a backlit keyboard.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The backlight is more useful than I thought it would be.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The display is beautiful.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It has good color, a wide viewing angle, and is plenty bright for indoor environments.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I would prefer that the screen wasn't glass, but the reflections aren't as bad as I feared.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If there is a bright light source behind you, you'll need to angle the screen to reduce the glare but it's workable.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The DVD drive is a DVD drive.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It feels slow and makes a lot of noise.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I've never owned an optical drive that I considered fast and quiet, and this one isn't any exception.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It works well, but isn't anything special.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The battery life is incredible.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The seven hour battery life is not an exaggeration if you are using the computer for light browsing and office apps.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Expect about 4-5 hours if you're using it for heavy web browsing and a bit of media.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Listening to music with the display off would easily last over the advertised 7 hours.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Streaming high definition video on netflix using wireless will knock it down to at or below three hours.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I haven't watched DVD movies on battery power but I expect it to barely get you through a single two hour film with a bit left over.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The size and weight are ideal for portability.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>4.5lbs doesn't exactly feel light until you compare it to similarly spec'd machines that weigh a full pound (20%) more.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I wouldn't want a larger machine if I had to lug it around much.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The speakers are quite good for a small light machine.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Don't expect much bass, but the sound is very clear with good mids and highs.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The speakers are plenty loud for listening to podcasts or music in a semi-quiet medium sized room or office.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I won't need to pack external speakers for use in my hotel room when I travel, like my last laptop.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The "magsafe" power adapter is more than just a gimmick, and more than just a way to avoid tripping and breaking your machine.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The "power brick" itself is a lot smaller than my last dell laptop.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's exactly the same size as the USB wall adapters that used to be included with ipods.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The cord is 6ft long and the brick includes fold-out wings to wrap the cord around.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It is very well thought-out for travel.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>With the cord wrapped up and the plug folded into the body, the power brick only takes up about 2.5" x 3" x 1" in your bag.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>When you are using it at home or at the office there is an included 6ft extension cord for the power brick so you aren't as tethered to your desk.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The computer runs very cool compared to most laptops.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Also, there are no vents where super-heated air blows out.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>While I'm sure it uses a fan, I've never audibly actually heard it run or felt a stream of warm air from it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I think it may vent through ports and the keyboard but it runs cool enough that you don't notice it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Edited to add: it does get rather warm when watching high resolution video, but stays quite cool when web browsing or using normal office apps.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Even when very warm, the fan is still quiet (the only way to actually hear the fan is to hold it near your ear).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The only drawback to the hardware compared to Windows machines is the fact that there is no option to hibernate when closing the lid.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It sleeps when you close the lid but it still is using a small amount of power.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If you're only going to be away for a couple hours this isn't an issue, but you must completely shut down when on battery power if you're going to be away much longer.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This machine is a lot more expensive than similarly spec'd Windows machines but I feel that it's worth the money.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I'm a very satisfied Mac switcher.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>??</sentcont></sentence>

<con><sentence>
<sentcont> Since I have to put something in this box, a 3rd USB port would be nice</sentcont>
<sentcont>But not a must by any means </sentcont>
</sentence></con>
<freereview><sentence><sentcont>I got the high end 13-inch MBP, and I love it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The processor and GPU make easy work of 99% of tasks that one could do on the computer.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The included software is wonderfully easy to use, yet quite powerful for a consumer machine.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The battery life is second to none, and one of the only computers that achieves and even exceeds its rated battery life.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The screen is brilliant and colorful, the backlit keyboard is very nice to have at night.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I've had this machine for a few weeks now, and have had no issues.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Occasionally, when doing a very processor intensive task, the case will heat up, but it is still cool enough to keep on your lap without any discomfort.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>And the SD card slot is a wonderful feature.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I'm a college student and I take a lot of photos, so its very convenient.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>No matter what I do, I cannot use up all the RAM, and the processor always has more power to give.</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>All has been said about the coolness of the design.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>And it is right.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This is arguably the cutest computer ever produced.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Its operating System, Snow Leopard, is arguably the cutest and most stable operating system ever produced.BUT..... besides cool factor and the OS, this computer is born flawed and is a no-go for many professional users.With the removal of the ExpressCard slot, many Hi-Performance devices and professional peripherals are now impossible to use, including, but not limited to Hi speed SATA Harddisks, 3G Modems, additional FW800 ports, etc.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The USB ports are now all shared, with the addition of the (USB) card reader.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This shared ports not only have suffered many interference problems on the former MBP's for years, but the no-expresscard slot of my previous point makes things worse, leaving your $3000 computer with only two jerky, half-usb's for (teenager) expansion purposes The firewire connector quality is worse.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The "MINI" connectors are much more prone to accidental sudden disconnections, which may not sound very critical if copying the family+dog last weekend videos, but is certainly dangerous when using professional audio or storage devices.In</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>I love the MacBook.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Sure it take a little bit getting used to, having been a PC user prior to getting my MacBook Pro, but once you get a hang of everything, it's flowing and amazing and so much better than a PC.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I love how simplistic it is in it's beautiful design, but also navigation.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I would take my MacBook Pro 13.3" over any PC, any day.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>?? The thing that I have found that I love the MOST about the MacBook Pro is the adapter.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The reason I switched to a Mac was because of the charging adaptor on my old PC.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It was awful.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Hundreds of dollars was shelled out her and there just to get the internal mechanisms back together because the prongs apparently fell apart and therefore my PC could not charge.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This is obviously mortifying when you need a computer for whatever important purposes but, due to the fact that it literally keeps on breaking on you, cannot do much about it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This is why the Mac is great.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Since Mac owns all it's products, you can be sure that you'll have top-of-the-line stuff and stuff that, if problems ever come about won't become an issue for a very, very long time, or will be fixed expediantly.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>?? Overall, my MacBook Pro 13.3" is AMAZING! and I would recoommend it to anyone looking for a good, handy, durable computer.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I would say that the price you have to pay (as this is what seems to deter most people, the heafty price tag!) is well worth it in the long run!</sentcont></sentence>

<sentcont> Well, I had switched to the Mac world about a year back, and really enjoyed working on my Macbook (white 2.16GHz Intel Core2Duo)</sentcont>
<sentcont>In my opinion, it's not so much the looks or the finish of the hardware that's important</sentcont>
<sentcont>It's just that the Mac OS X is far far superior to anything I'd seen, and certainly better than Windows - in terms of ease of use, performance, stability, anything really</sentcont>
<sentcont>When I saw the new line of Macbook Pro, in the lovely aluminium body, 7hr battery life, illuminated keyboard, SD card slot, I just couldn't resist the temptation to upgrade</sentcont>
<sentcont>Not that I needed to, but it just seemed so..</sentcont>
<sentcont>yummy :-) What can I say, I just love my new Macbook Pro 13, even though it's the lower spec of the two in that range</sentcont>
</sentence></pro>
<con><sentence>
<sentcont> A bit expensive compared to Windows laptops of similar hardware specs</sentcont>
<sentcont>But not as much if compared to a similar VAIO or ASUS</sentcont>
<sentcont>Anyway, I think Apple's market share is going up and could further get boosted if the prices are brought down a bit more</sentcont>

<sentcont> Gorgeous Improved LED Backlit Display, Multi-Touch Glass Trackpad, Standard Backlit Keyboard, Return of FireWire, Surprising Addition of SD Card Slot, Graphics, Pricing, Unibody Design </sentcont>
</sentence></pro>
<con><sentence>
<sentcont> I expected the HDD to be a little bigger as it is now a "Pro" laptop </sentcont>
</sentence></con>
<freereview><sentence><sentcont>I purchased the Unibody MacBook in October, and I sold it just to get the new MacBook Pro.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I have to agree that the new 13" MacBook Pro deserves the name "Pro" in it now.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It has much better features, and this should have been the computer that the Unibody MacBook was back in October.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Ever since Apple introduced the Unibody MacBook, many people complained about the loss of FireWire and the terrible screen quality.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Fortunately, Apple responded to those complaints with the new 13" MacBook Pro.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The return of FireWire has made a lot of people happy, and the surprising addition of the SD Card slot made it even better.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The quality of the screen is also a lot better.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The screen displays much better colors, and it still carries the revolutionary LED backlit.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The pricing of the MacBook Pro line has also dropped significantly.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The original 15" Pro was starting at the price of $1999, but they dropped it by $300 making it $1699.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The Unibody MacBook was asking for $1299, but they are now asking for $1199 with the addition of the new features.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I am very pleased that they dropped the price, as it is very rare to hear Apple drop their prices.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The new features make it much more affordable.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The computer still looks identical to the previous October notebook revision.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It still carries the sexy Unibody design, and the backlit keyboard is now standard on all models.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I actually find the backlit keyboard very useful, even as a touch typist.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The gorgeous glass multi-touch trackpad still pleases me with the features and the size.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>After the rebranding of the Unibody MacBook, and the addition of the new features.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Apple has really stepped up to the plate.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>They successfully tightened up the competition, as the new MacBook Pro line is now much more affordable and is priced very well.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The new 13" MacBook Pro does feel like a "Pro" computer, where the performance is hard to feel unsatisfied.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The graphics are incredible.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Even if you feel that the MacBook Pro line is still too much, Apple is also offering the classic MacBook line for a low price of $999.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If you purchase this laptop now, you'll be able to upgrade to Snow Leopard for only $10.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>With the gorgeous Unibody design, LED backlit display, and trackpad, $1199 is a price that cannot be beaten.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Great job Apple!</sentcont></sentence>

<con><sentence>
<sentcont> outdated processor, no applications that support the GPU for calculations, low resolution screen, large frame that surrounds the screen (makes screen small)</sentcont>
<sentcont>The video profiles for HD TV monitors are messed up</sentcont>
<sentcont>Not only in timing, but in position</sentcont>
</sentence></con>
<freereview><sentence><sentcont>BIG disappointment for photo, video and scientific applications.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Apple base their hierarchy on size.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The bigger the laptop the more options.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Some of us would prefer Apple just base their scale on price.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I like to see a small form factor laptop like the 13 inch have the Nvidia discrete GPU options as the 15 and 17 inch.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Yes, we understand battery life will be shorter.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>For some reason no one is utilizing the GPU, even Apple's Mac OS X.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The HD video profiles have been purposely altered to be unfriendly with HD TVs.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>A obvious ploy to get people to buy Apple branded monitors.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Bads  1 - Snow Leopard has taken on a whole new set of video profiles that discourages people from using their huge HD TVs.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I imagine this is Steve Jobs way of forcing people to buy Apple's over priced monitors.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Even if one scales back to 10.5 the update deletes the working video profiles and replaces it with the defective ones. 2 - Processor is outdated.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>3 - No Nvidia discrete GPU option.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>4 - Sharp points on the unibody case.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>5 - screen still does not open 180 degrees.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>6 - stuck up attitude when it comes to sharing a monitor via KVM.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It simply doesn't want to work through a KVM. 7 - Snow Leopard doesn't want to work with Windows servers, even worse then the older Mac OS X. Again Stevey boy wanting to force his loyal Apple customers to buy only Apple stuff.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>8 - Considering the features, its WAY over priced.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The same hardware on a PC machine costs only haf as much.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I understand Apple wants to make a profit, but this is too much.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>9 - no express card slot !</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Oh no, people may want to use non Apple Store hardware and have the freedom to update drivers on those hardware.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Good 1 - Dual bootable machine using bootcamp.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>2 - Unibody design 3 - Plenty of memory.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>4 - Nvidia GPU 5 - backlit keyboard  Conclusion:  Apple has become iTunes.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Just one big profiteering entity.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>They are strategically engineering their loyal clients to have no choice and over pay for products.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Mac OS X is nothing special, its FreeBSD, a OS made by college students on their free time out of passion for creating, without any pay.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Which Apple is making billions off of.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Apple hardware is behind on the times.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The iphone is buried in policies with ATT.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Nothing can be done on the iphone without the explicit approval of Apple and ATT.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Steve Jobs is a face man, he has no scientific or technical skills.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Not someone that should be running a tech company.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>They think they are different then other Corporate America.</sentcont></sentence>
