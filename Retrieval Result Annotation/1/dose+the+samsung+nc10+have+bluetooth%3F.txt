<sentence><sentcont>There isn't much that I can find wrong with it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The screen size is a little small if youre not used to it, but thats the way all netbooks are.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>A feature i love about this model is the font increase mode: you spread your fingers farther apart on the mouse-pad and the font becomes larger; pull your fingers closer together and the font becomes smaller.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Its very nice.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It has plenty of memory, a nice built in camera, and a nice keyboard.</sentcont></sentence>

<sentcont> The Samsung NC10 has plenty of good points, the most imporant of which are: its compact size, a very bright evenly lit screen, a nicely weighted keyboard with near full size keys, battery life of about 6 hours on near full screen brightness (maximum brightness is VERY bright), a good but not overly sensitive track pad with scrolling, 1 gigabyte of RAM - enough for Windows XP which is the supplied operating system and a 160 gigabyte SATA hard drive</sentcont>
<sentcont> There are 3 USB sockets, microphone and headphone sockets, a VGA socket and a Lan socket and a SD card slot - so plenty of connectivity</sentcont>
<sentcont>Wi Fi connectivity is very good</sentcont>
<sentcont>It feels solid and well put together (mostly - see below) and is fairly quiet running</sentcont>
<sentcont>I am pleased with it</sentcont>
</sentence></pro>
<con><sentence>
<sentcont> No real bad points but a few issues   the case on mine can creak a little even though the build quality is good overall</sentcont>
<sentcont>1 gig of RAM is not enough for Vista or Windows 7 which I have now installed so I have upgraded to 2 gig   a very easy task</sentcont>
<sentcont>The sound could be better   it is very low in output but I find this acceptable for such good portability and very high degree of usability</sentcont>

<sentcont>Build quality seems fine so far</sentcont>
<sentcont>Peripheral connectivity is well-catered for, with three USB ports, the wi-fi has been faultless at every location I've tried and even the on-board Bluetooth paired with a Logitech Bluetooth mouse (also white!) and has connected every time since, without any lag</sentcont>

<sentcont> Low screen resolution means a lot of scrolling is needed whilst web browsing</sentcont>

<sentcont>The on board speakers sound tinny and lack power and the supplied slip case is next to useless at offering any real protection whilst transporting the NC10</sentcont>
<sentcont>The NC10 is quite expensive, considering how little one needs to pay for a standard, entry level notebook these days, but in the world of netbooks, the NC10 stands head and shoulders above the competition and for very good reason</sentcont>

<sentcont> Nice sleek looking sexy netbook (well done Samsung!), good battery life, though normally it lasts upto 4 hours when it says 6</sentcont>
<sentcont>Nice layout with good screen size</sentcont>
<sentcont>Has all the usual bits/features</sentcont>
<sentcont>This netbook has nearly all the features of top end lightweight laptops like Sony T series except for the price</sentcont>
<sentcont> You actually don't need a laptop, this netbook does all the job plus you can purchase Samsung SE-S084C, External USB 2.0 Slimline 8X DVD Writer, Black which is perfect compliment to it</sentcont>
</sentence></pro>
<con><sentence>
<sentcont> The mouse/track pad can be a bit tricky/too sensitive as sometimes when navigating the the screen/image can be zoomed without untending to</sentcont>
<sentcont> Software should have come with MS Office at least with trial version if not the full version as it cannot be easily installed without having to use an external DVD/CD drive and downloading MS office is not an ideal option as only MS office 2010 is available online when given its operating system is Windows XP, it is better suited to MS office 2003</sentcont>
<sentcont>  Could have done better with internal mobile broadband SIM option and would have prefferred by having an extra USB port, totalling to 4 USB</sentcont>
<sentcont> Also the display, thought good, it could have done better with a much higher resolution as some programme and website requires this (though Samsung has explained of getting around this on its website)</sentcont>
<sentcont>  When starting netbook for the 1st time, it gives the option of partitioning the hard drive, but the option of determining the size of the drive can be easily be missed as it happened in my case, hence partitioning 50% of the entire drive which would sendomnly be used accept for recovery</sentcont>
<sentcont>This can distort the normal perception of having 160 GB hard drive</sentcont>
<sentcont> Make sure to carefully select the size of hard drive when given the option of partitioning at startup as once selected, it cannot be changed</sentcont>

<sentcont> Battery life excellent - will run for over 7 hours on full charge with light use, eg</sentcont>
<sentcont>surfing or word-processing</sentcont>
<sentcont>Screen is clear, evenly lit, bright and glare resistant</sentcont>
<sentcont>Sound through headphones is excellent</sentcont>
<sentcont>Keyboard is almost full size, and very nice to type on</sentcont>
<sentcont>My typing on this keyboard is actually slightly faster and more accurate than on a full-sized keyboard</sentcont>
<sentcont>Keys are sensibly positioned eg</sentcont>
<sentcont>'CTRL' is bottom left, 'Enter' key is good size and right-shift is easily found; much better than the keyboards on any other netbooks I looked at</sentcont>
<sentcont>Can be left on standby by closing lid and returned to the following day with no apparent loss of battery life - an excellent machine</sentcont>
<sentcont>SD / SD HC card slot useful for data backups</sentcont>
<sentcont>Wireless connection quick to connect from boot-up and has good range</sentcont>
<sentcont>There are numerous reviews of the NC10 on the web, mostly very positive; I haven't been disappointed</sentcont>
</sentence></pro>
<con><sentence>
<sentcont> Balance is slightly off   tends to tip backwards unless you support it correctly to compensate</sentcont>
<sentcont>Having used for a couple of weeks now though I soon adjusted to this and no longer find it a problem</sentcont>
<sentcont>Speakers are a bit weedy, but good enough for general use</sentcont>
<sentcont>If I want to listen to music then I generally use headphones anyway</sentcont>
<sentcont>No CD / DVD drive, but if you have another PC on your wireless network you can share the drives on that machine with the NC10 for data and applications</sentcont>

<sentcont> When I was researching the Netbooks on the market, I found they tended to fall into two groups;   1)Nice keyboard</sentcont>
<sentcont>Shame about the screen</sentcont>
<sentcont> 2) Nice screen, shame about the keyboard</sentcont>
<sentcont>  I eventually realised that if I was going to live with the device for any period of time, I had better fork out the little bit extra for the Samsung NC10</sentcont>
<sentcont> For the size of netbook, the keyboard is superb</sentcont>
<sentcont>Unlike many of it's rivals, the NC10's 'RETURN' key is an inversed "L"</sentcont>
<sentcont>This makes typing much easier</sentcont>
<sentcont>It was one of the main reasons for buying this unit</sentcont>
<sentcont> The screen is also excellent</sentcont>
<sentcont>The brightness is lovely & punchy</sentcont>
<sentcont>The screen surface is slightly matt to reduce reflection</sentcont>
<sentcont>If you like your battery life long, let the supplied power-save programme controll the screen</sentcont>
<sentcont>It will run at full brightness when on mains power</sentcont>
<sentcont>But when on battery, it will dim the screen slightly and then dim it further after a period of non use</sentcont>
<sentcont>As a result, the already high powered battery gives excellent performance</sentcont>
<sentcont> The lid on the blue model has a lovely gloss finnish</sentcont>
<sentcont>Considdering it has a traditional hard drive, the NC10 is surprisingly quiet</sentcont>
<sentcont>The ram can be upgraded via a small access panel and the power pack is a nice size too</sentcont>
<sentcont> I have used it for about an hour every day and I can safely say I made the right decision</sentcont>
</sentence></pro>
<con><sentence>
<sentcont> The battery (although a nice shape) adds weight</sentcont>
<sentcont>But you cannot change the laws of physics</sentcont>
<sentcont>A better battery is a heavier battery</sentcont>
<sentcont>My previous laptop was a desk top emulating beast</sentcont>
<sentcont>So the NC10 does not really offend</sentcont>
<sentcont> Samsung have used a relatively proprietry power socket</sentcont>
<sentcont>This limits your choice of car chargers ect..</sentcont>
<sentcont>At least on the high street anyway</sentcont>
<sentcont> It's lovely that Samsung has supplied a free case, but a little bit of padding, on the bottom at least would have made it perfect</sentcont>
