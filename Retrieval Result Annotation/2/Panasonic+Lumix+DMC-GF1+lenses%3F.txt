<freereview><sentence><sentcont>Most ultra-zoom digital cameras are big and bulky, but the 10.1-megapixel,        12x Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS3?? has a unique optical system that        makes it one of the only pocket-sized ultra-zoom digital cameras.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The Panasonic        Lumix DMC-ZS3 measures a minuscule 2.35 inches by 4.07 inches by 1.29 inches        and weighs 7.2 ounces.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Compared to more advanced ultra-zooms like the,        that's up to an inch shorter, three-quarters of an inch narrower and two        inches thinner.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS3 is also more than 12 ounces      lighter than the heavyweight SX10 and 6 ounces less than the middleweight      FZ28.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The advantage in size comes with trade-offs in features.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Simply put, the      Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS3 is strictly a point-and-shoot camera.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The 12x zoom      lens has optical image stabilization but a relatively short 25 mm to 300      mm focal length range.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>There's no electric viewfinder, only the 3-inch LCD      display, which is larger those found on the SX10 and FZ28.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>And while Panasonic      Lumix ZS3 comes with HD movie mode and can record to SD, SDHC (high capacity)      and MultiMedia memory cards (MMC), it lacks RAW (uncompressed image file)      support, manual modes, a high-speed shutter and burst modes.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>However, reviewers      say it's easy to use, with 22 scene modes, an intelligent ISO feature for      reducing image blur, zippy performance and good picture but slightly soft      image quality.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>However, anyone wanting more control might take a look at      the highly rated Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ28.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It isn't nearly as compact, but      the Panasonic Lumix FZ28 has an 18x zoom lens, more manual controls, and      supports RAW image and HD format -- and all for a lower price.????</sentcont></sentence>

<sentcont> The DMC TZ7 is a brilliant camera</sentcont>
<sentcont>It takes great quality photos with vibrant colours, and lots of detail</sentcont>
<sentcont>The 12x optical zoom and wide-angle lens are great for people who want to take shots of landscapes and large group shots</sentcont>
<sentcont> The HD video quality is excellent too, filming in 720p at highest settings</sentcont>
<sentcont>The great things about the video are: the ability to use the full 12x optical zoom, the dedicated record button, and the stereo microphone which does a great job of picking up all your sounds from high, low and mid frequencies in crystal clear quality</sentcont>
<sentcont> The camera has lots of useful features such as 2 "my scene" settings on the mode dial which allow you to select your 2 favourite scene modes and give them dedicated positions on the dial</sentcont>
<sentcont>I for example chose panorama and landscape</sentcont>
<sentcont>Other great features include the ability to save up to 6 of your friend's faces in the camera so when they're in a shot it focuses on them</sentcont>
<sentcont>You can edit everything from white balance to colour tone and it has standard Panasonic menus</sentcont>
<sentcont>For the nerds amongst you it also features a mini HDMI out to connect straight to your TV</sentcont>
<sentcont> Definitely a perfect choice for anyone who wants a compact camera which packs many features seen in SLRs but at a much lower price</sentcont>
<sentcont>I'd suggest that anyone buying this camera get a 16GB SDHC memory card at least as this will give you about 2 hours of HD video at highest quality</sentcont>
<sentcont>I highly recommend this camera</sentcont>
</sentence></pro>
<con><sentence>
<sentcont> The supplied battery is rechargeable, but a bit small</sentcont>
<sentcont>It should last you a reasonable time on full charge taking photos, but using the flash and taking video will take its toll</sentcont>
<sentcont>I'd recommend getting a second battery as they are not cumbersome</sentcont>
<sentcont>The problem is the latest firmware doesn't support third party batteries, so you'll have to fork out on an expensive Panasonic one</sentcont>
<sentcont> Although technically a compact camera, it's a little on the bulky side due largely to the zoom lens</sentcont>
<sentcont>If you have large pockets it should be OK, but you're unlikely to get it in there inside a case</sentcont>
<sentcont> There have been complaints about the mode dial being a bit loose</sentcont>
<sentcont>Panasonic seem to have improved the dial making it a bit stiffer</sentcont>
<sentcont>However, it could still get turned when inside your pocket</sentcont>
<sentcont>Due to the camera's size</sentcont>
<sentcont>The camera might also turn on in your pocket too</sentcont>
<sentcont> My only other niggles are the fact you have to remove the camera's battery and put it in a charge unit rather than charging it in the camera, and the supplied USB cable is propriety, so you have to take the cable with you if you want to connect the camera to anyone else's computer</sentcont>
<sentcont> They could have packed in a case and HDMI cable, but there camera is great value as it is, so these would only up the price</sentcont>

<sentcont>As long as I leave it on intelligent auto it does every thing, it even bleeps to tell me it doesn't want to take a photo</sentcont>
<sentcont>I can't compare it with other cameras, the last one I bought was an Olympus 1.3mp, 9 years ago and still going strong, but I read every report I could find and the TZ7 came out best..</sentcont>
<sentcont>I'm very happy with it</sentcont>
</sentence></pro>
<con><sentence>
<sentcont> The worst thing about the camera is the greedy company who made it PANASONIC, they charge nearly ?50 for a spare battery, they want us to be ggratefulbecause now we can't over charge the thing, it has some sort of chip in it to stop that happening...</sentcont>
<sentcont>when was the last time you overcharged a battery?</sentcont>
<sentcont>If your camera was made after some time in June, or had the firmware updated to ver 1.2, you must buy their battery, I tied a cheap replacement and a message came up telling me it would not work with that battery and switched off</sentcont>
<sentcont>Panasonic are just getting two bites of the cherry.</sentcont>
<sentcont>the same way as the inkjet printer people tried</sentcont>
<sentcont>I can buy a heavy duty battery for my car for less.</sentcont>

<reviewtitle>Unbeatable Value. HD Video, 10x Zoom, in your pocket!!</reviewtitle>
<rating>1.0</rating>
<pro><sentence>
<sentcont> Shoots HD video at 720p/30fps - 10x zoom in point and shoot frame - You can zoom while taking video!!</sentcont>
<sentcont>- IMHO most features available for your $$$</sentcont>
</sentence></pro>
<con><sentence>
<sentcont> No optical viewfinder - No manual focus - No video camera lights </sentcont>
</sentence></con>
<freereview><sentence><sentcont>I'm no fanboy of Panasonic; I'd never even heard of Lumix before I started shopping for a new digital camera about a year ago.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The blogs reported about 2 cameras that were coming out that shot HD video, a feature I absolutely wanted, this and the Cannon.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The TZ5 also came with a 10x zoom, as well.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This is definitely a rare feature, and I can't remember how many times I cursed my old Pentax for only having 3x.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The icing on the cake was the availability to zoom while recording video!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This feature is awesome and essentially makes your picture camera a camcorder.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The picture quality IMO is amazing.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I constantly get compliments about them, and am able to do a lot of cropping etc; however, Im sure most cams output good quality at 9MP.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Ill defer to CNET on that issue, but I'm certainly happy with it...  Now things that annoy me: no optical viewfinder- meh I don't really miss one, but some ppl might be annoyed by it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In the camera's defense, the screen is SUPER bright and SUPER crisp (i think it was the highest resolution at the time).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>No manual focus... this one kinda upsets me.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>my old optioS had a basic manual zoom function that i LOVED (I'm certainly no professional, but I'd consider myself a hobbyist).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Alas, there is no manual focus here.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>in fact everything is pretty much automated for you.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>so if you don't know jack about cameras this is good for you, if not, you can change the ISO, flash, focus settings, but no manual focus.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>No video camera light.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I don't know any point and shoots that have this, but CMON ppl!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I'd love to take video at night.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Finally, I think it shoots in H.264, but I hate using QuickTime, I'd rather it record to Divx directly...  Here are some example shots I've taken (last one is a video): http://flickr.com/photos/robstak/2441745295/in/set-72157604732261074/ http://flickr.com/photos/robstak/2483601950/in/set-72157605001595717/ http://flickr.com/photos/robstak/2485882077/in/set-72157605001595717/</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In summary, I absolutely LOVE this camera, and couldn't recommend it more...</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It has its shortcomings, but as point and shoots go I dont' see a better value.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I shopped for a replacement for my optioS for months and months and waited till this came around (if only it still fit in an altoids tin, lol).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So look at this and look at the Cannon, but my money is on the TZ5</sentcont></sentence>

<sentcont> This is an excellent compact camera, my third digital camera, second Panasonic camera after my last one was lost</sentcont>
<sentcont>   The wide angle and macro are excellent for geting panoramics and close-ups</sentcont>
<sentcont>   I notice it is often described as a travel camera in reviews, which is a good description, I have been on 2 trips away and have many excellent photos thanks to its versatility and intelligent auto functions</sentcont>
<sentcont>    According to reviews I read, the battery life was supposed to be poor, however I find it very good</sentcont>
</sentence></pro>
<con><sentence>
<sentcont> Very few bad points, don't expect SLR quality pictures when you zoom in on detail, but it is still very impressive quality and probably best in its class (as a travel compact)</sentcont>
<sentcont>   Flash looks small but comes out pretty good, may have been better with a shoe for additional flash capability</sentcont>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>I bought this camera because it works smoothly with my Mac and because it shoots HD movies.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I know the purists say you should have a dedicated movie camera if you are into shooting home video, but I find a good quality compact digital camera is much easier to carry around and less intimidating to your subjects when you're shooting footage at friendly gatherings.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I have a Sony DSC t100 which is an awesome little camera and created great video, but it doesn't interface well with my Mac (no audio on movies), and I have to run the footage through Roxio program on my PC to convert to AVi, then copy the AVI files to my Mac.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Tedious and time-consuming.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I also wanted to upgrade to a compact digital that shot movies in HD.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I like to use stills from my video footage in my finished IMovies and HD video allows for pretty good stills.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I loved so much about the DMC TZ5, but the audio for my finished movies was very poor compared to the Sony.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>You can really only hear the person shooting the footage clearly (if he/she avoids covering the poorly-located microphone with his/her left index finger), and you miss a lot of the dialogue of the subjects.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This is a huge flaw if you're doing home movies, since some of the best audio comes from side comments and reactions--I'm not filming just to hear myself speak.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I used the camera for a few weeks and did some short films on my Mac, but I just couldn't get past the low volume of the audio track.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The microphone barely picks up audio more than a couple of feet away.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I did extensive research before buying the TZ5 and did not see this issue mentioned anywhere.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The superb quality of my Sony may have spoiled me, but I had to send the Lumix back.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I may just stick to Sony and hope the company eventually decides to play well with Macs in the future.</sentcont></sentence>

<reviewtitle>standing "O" for the ZS3</reviewtitle>
<rating>1.0</rating>
<freereview><sentence><sentcont>I have owned two prior digital cameras- the first was a Canon that took good pictures, but was too bulky to pocket around and required AA batteries to power it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The second was a Sony CyberShot DSC-W150 that took crappy, blurry pictures in low light.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Needless to say, I felt an upgrade was in order.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So I'm going on an east coast trip next month.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>My buddy and I are avid baseball fans.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>One problem: as we do not always have great seats, taking close-up pictures of ballplayers is a real pain with 99% of the compact point and shoots out there.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This is because the camera's size will only allow it 5X optical zoom.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>You can combine this with digital zooming, but I don't need to tell you how terrible and pixilated this looks.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Thus my conundrum.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So I really wanted a compact, pocketable camera with a long range optical lens, without having to lug around an expensive digital SLR.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Enter the Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS3.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>When I read the specs on it, I was in awe. 10 megapixel, 12X OPTICAL zoom.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Here's the sweetest part about the zoom- if you planning to use smaller prints (i.e. 4X6), you can quickly adjust the camera's Megapixel (MP) count from 10 to 7, 5, and 3 to yield maximum OPTICAL zooms of 14.3, 17.1, and 21.4 respectably, without much loss of detail on such prints.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I wish Panasonic would have allowed the camera to adjust the MP count automatically as you zoom, but it's not too much trouble to change the MP settings manually from the quick menu.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Another great feature: the camera's screen is beautiful at 460,000 pixels, twice the count as the rival Canon Powershot SX200 IS (more on that camera later).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>From the moment you view your first picture, you'll quickly notice how much sharper photos look on this camera.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's a nice convenience to view photos on the camera in a manner closer to the quality that will actually be seen when you're viewing them on the computer (and ultimately printing them).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I also want to give Panasonic kudos for the build quality and compactness of this camera.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The ZS3 is a replacement for the popular TZ5 model, which was 9MP and 10X Optical Zoom.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So they increased the resolution, and added a wider range lens, and REDUCED the size by .4 cubic inches.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Specifications aside, I was more than pleased that this camera will comfortably fit inside my jeans pocket.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's a bit bulkier than an ultracompact for sure, but not objectionably so.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Note that the SX200 is a full 2.0 cubic inches thicker, another reason I passed on the Canon.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Here's a few more reasons the Canon falls short: the Canon has a cheesy looking popup flash that sticks out at the top of the camera, whether you're using flash or not (bad design decision).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It has less rated battery life than the Lumix.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Also, when shooting video, the Canon does NOT allow you to use optical zooming.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Photo quality on the Lumix is excellent, although I've only snapped samples around my place so far.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>However, I've taken quite a few pictures at low light, and at maximum zoom levels to try to get a bad shot.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So far, there's none to be found.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I'll put this through its paces more when I travel next month, but I'm extremely pleased so far.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>As for video shooting, I've sampled it a bit, and it seems pretty solid.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The camera gives you the choice of shooting video in its touted AVCHD Lite format (ideal for watching it on your TV in HD with an optional mini to standard HDMI cable), or JPEG if you prefer to email video clips to friends.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This year's model also added stereo sound on video playback versus last year's monaural effort.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>One thing I found a bit strange, was the incredibly slow zooming when shooting video.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I guess Panasonic was trying to give the user a more controlled, deliberate zoom, but unlike the snappy photo zooming, it's a bit slow for my liking.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Some other minor quibbles: The dial that controls the shooting mode is extremely loose.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If you lightly rub it against anything (a camera bag, your pocket), there's a good chance it will shift.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>When you turn the camera on, it will digitally tell you what mode you're in, but it's still annoying when it happens by accident.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Second, when making a quick zoom on an object, it will appear blurry on the camera's screen until the shutter button is pressed.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>There are modes to continually focus the object when zooming, but this drains the camera's battery life more rapidly.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It would be nice if this feature was incorporated automatically without any such sacrifice.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Also, I'm not a huge fan of the included PhotofunStudio software bundled with this camera, as there are other, more compelling programs to view, edit, and print photos (I like Canon's Zoombrowser program better).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Finally, this is not the camera to buy if you're into manual controls.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>There's a ton of preset scenes that can be used (nighttime, portrait, baby, sunset, food, etc.), and you can adjust items like flash, white balance, and max ISO level, but this is meant to be a simple point and shoot for casual photographers.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Note that the Lumix has an intelligent auto mode (IA) that will analyze the shooting conditions and pick the right scene, flash, and exposure without any adjustments by the user.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This camera screams simplicity, but there's enough tweaking on the Normal and Scene modes to keep the vast majority of amateur photographers happy.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Regardless of these nitpicks, the Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS3 is an awesome camera, unbeatable for those that want the best of both worlds- a great zoom lens and compact body.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's a bit pricey at $399, but you're getting quite a lot of camera for your hard earned dollars.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I have no doubt that my third digital camera is a terrific buy and a long-term staple for my travels.</sentcont></sentence>

<sentcont> I like panasonic cameras they are sturdy, reliable and produce excellent photographs </sentcont>
</sentence></pro>
<con><sentence>
<sentcont> I think overall its a little expensive for what features it has in comparance to say tz6 (Which is not that much different and cheaper) also Dial on top of camera always moves when taking in/out of camera case, and when you want to take picture in a hurry screen tells you "dial not in correct position" other than that i think its an excellent camera </sentcont>

<sentcont> Excellent HiDef video capability</sentcont>
<sentcont>Most cameras allow you to choose video mode by turning the dial on the top of the camera</sentcont>
<sentcont>I prefer the way it is selected in this camera ie with a single button on the back of the camera</sentcont>
<sentcont>I bought this camera in anticipatio of the birth of my first child</sentcont>
<sentcont>I have therefore found the baby setting on it useful</sentcont>
<sentcont>It records the name and age of the child on the picture</sentcont>
</sentence></pro>
<con><sentence>
<sentcont> I struggle to think of any but the system of menus is a little long and complicated</sentcont>
<sentcont>The shutter release button should be where the scene dial is, in my opinion</sentcont>
