<freereview><sentence><sentcont>i've had the nokia n95 for about 2 months now and i've had no problems at all.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>the many features of this phone have come in very handy and i have the most powerful fone in my household.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>the only thng that are wrong wth this phone is the battery life and the lack of RAM! it comes standard with 64mb worth of ram which is quite scarce for a phone with this many features bt as soon as you boot up yhe phone, ur only left with 20mb! now that's just ridiculous!.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>putting together a fone with just 64mb ram is just pointless and vurtually makes simple applications or even multitasking impossible!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>if you try and browse something over the net, and the web page is full of complex media, which most web pages do have nowerdays, then it most certainly will close!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>RAM is the only thing that is affecting this fone otherwise it would've been perfect, i've heard that incrasing ram would drain the battery power to the max but there's a simple answer 2 that - supply the nokia n95 with a better phone!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>i hope this is the last time nokia puts this low amount of ram into their high end phones because the way fone technology is advancing now, 64mb of ram will not be enough to suit our demands from our fones!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>so this isn't what computers have become but they aren't far off, keep on going nokia!</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>I grabbed my n95 day of release, thrilled to think that one year ago the rumours that were being spread of an n83 had truly been turned into the actual n95.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>now i'm having seccond thoughts...was it worth my $1254 aud?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>yes i know i cbf shopping around.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>firstly, gps- so slow.... takes me about 5 minutes to conect to sat.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>although i've never used another gps system, i am guessing this is not normal.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I have heard other people complain of this too, but they say it gets quicker with time.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>loading google maps is good, but the onboard mapping system is just as good i think.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>i've found google maps requires you to have internet connection to be able to see the actual map(so great if ur in a wifi area.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>but bad if u don't have cheap gprs connections...) anybody know a workaround?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>onboard mapping software allowed me to see where i was without connection to network.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>although i was driving 15 minutes away, it took 5-8 minutes to connect to sat.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>to get coordinates and then after another 2 mintues of fumbling buttons to set destination and start trip calculations, i was about 200 m from destination (i had to park because i wanted to see it in action!!!)    so when it was working it seemed fine.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>but, as other people have found, voice nav.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>requires $$$$ and it came up with an annoying statement etc asking me to subscribe.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>imagine i was really lost, there goes my $ subscribing to year of nokia maps.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Actual phone is a bit of a letdown, lags, resets itself randomly (4times in 4 days) keep pressing menu button by accident instead of left or right arrow key.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>so what i have big thumbs.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>camera lags when on 5mp mode.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>havnt tried any other mode.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>but its about 2-5 seconds b/w pressing the button to take pic and actually seeing the image on screen of ur final pic...strange.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>on n95 screen, pics seem a liiiitle grainy...    wifi keeps dropping me out.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>well, this may be due to my network, and i hope it is for the n95s repuation... but it really shits me.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>downloading videos off the included reuters links, get dropped out from wireless...    3.5mm headphone jack is great.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>great sound quality, i personally believe (although i havn't heard it through a good pair of headphones) inbuilt speakers have an amazing ability to project themselves...and also have an amazing ability to split ear drums with high pitched onboard nokia tones...argh!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Battery life is the other m a j o r letdown.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>with using wifi maybe 5 minutes, gps on my 15 min car ride which turned into 20 cos i stopped to play with gps, about 5 minutes of normal call time and 5minutes of bluetooth call time and about 3 minutes of speaker call time, my battery is wailing for a charge as I type.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>-i have not got more than one day with propper use of functions without either needing to charge or noticing it was on one bar and thinking it would die tomorrow if i listen to mp3.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Although I knew what it's size was before I got it, i still miss the slim 8250 in my pocket.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>god i love that phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>=P    So after closely following rumours and exclusive reviews posted all over the net, desperately awaiting the device that is not just one thing, it's many.... i've almost convinced myself its not worth the price.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>ALMOST.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>-happy with reception (as you would expect fomr a high end phone)  -dual slide ability is fantastic   -screen is awesome, colorful, bright biiiig...  -music playback is to me ipod comparable (well i have 3gipod,time for new1)  -inbox equipment is more than generous.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>nokia included 1gb in the box and shop gave me a free 2gb...so thats sweet.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>inbox case is pretty protective and stylish...although i have worries about camera safety.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>~my zeiss optics!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>IS N95 WORTH IT??? DOES IT LIVE UPTO THE HYPE???  well, i'll leave that up to you to decide, i still can't decide.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>basically, i think, if you have the means, get it, but if ur jobless like me...don't waste all your money on release date!!! haha -but its damn sexy.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>cheers.</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>The N95 is NO WAY touch screen!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Not sure what you have got there...a possible fake?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Also, to the person who says they get only 7 hours on standby....What are you doing?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I NEVER got this on my N95.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Sometimes I would not have to charge it for 2 days before it got down to 3 bars and that would be by  listening to at least 3 hours of music, calls and texts and Internet usage.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I work for a known Mobile Phone retailer and I have realised that a lot of the times when customers claim 'poor battery life', this is due to a number of things.    1) Check that none of the applications are left running and are closed properly when you have finished using them.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If there is a small blue circle next to an application, this will indicate it is still running and has not been closed properly.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The best way to close it is to go to Options and select EXIT.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Repeat this as many times neccessary to get you back to the home screen.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>2) Having Bluetooth, Infrared, etc running also affects how many hours you will get from one charge cycle.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If it is a NEW phone you have just got, be sure to charge for AT LEAST 12 hours before using.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Even if it indicates fully charged after an hour or so, still let it charge minimum 12 hours, maximum 24 hours.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Check you have the latest Software.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Go to Nokia website for instructions on how to check this and update if neccesary....a SW update does wonders for loads of areas of the fone....</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>There is no way you would get 7 hours from the battery in Standby mode.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Though this can also depend on how long you have had the fone/battery and how many times it has been charged and if it has been used strenuously which in turn would increas the amount of times it needs to be charged.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If none of the above work, it is a relatively new fone then I can only assume you have a dodgy battery/fone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>change the battery first (if all the above options fail) and take it from there.</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>hi PFQR,    I have over a dozen appz and 80+ games downloaded free on my N73, so i would say it  is definitely the "best" possible all rounder set i can get.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>if anyone got $ to spare, they can always buy the N95, but i would say it is not a very rational decision to pay such a high premium over N73, for things like 3.5 mm audio output jack, TV out, dual slide mechanism, Wi-Fi, and 5 mpg camera.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's battery life, if you take note, is also less than N73's.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Map applications, if available, is also at a cost to user for usage i believe.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>First batches of any new nokia models always comes with bugs etc, so y be the first to get it?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Mobile phones prices also drop drastically over 3-6 mths anyway, and when 6 months or more passed, you be seeing newer models like, maybe N97, N99 or watever new nokia models again.........so wat's the point of getting one set so fast, for the sake of it?</sentcont></sentence>

<sentence><sentcont>I can't quite tell if i like it or not...</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I mean, it's got the SAT NAV system, and the 5MP camera With Wi-fi, EDGE and the fancy slide look, but is it all actually worth it?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Well...YES!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>For once Nokia have actually produced something that the public will like...    lets look at the SAT NAV...no need for a Bluetooth GPS as it's already built in, even though it does kill your bat!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The software is quite user freindly, but it still takes getting used to...</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The 5MP camera is great fun with it's TV out.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It probably has one of the best cameras for a phone in this range, but it's proper slow to load up and to take a pic.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But none of that matters, as the n95 is probably the best phone out on the market today with leading technology!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Well Nokia you suprised me once again!</sentcont></sentence>

<sentence><sentcont>The diffrent mobiles im concidering for my next buy.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>nokia n95, apple iphone, htc shift, nokia e90 comunicator, sony ericsson w960, sony ericsson p1.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Compare good and bad in relation to the other candidates.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>nokia n95  good: gps, vibrant high-res screen, 5 MP camera, vga video recording, hsdpa,   bad: short battery life, ugly, vuneruble dubble slide design, big, not touch screen.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>apple iphone  good: super screen, intuitive navigation, looks nice, nice webbrowser.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>bad: no hsdpa or 3g, no 3:e party program, no games, no custuomizations, no java, no multitasking, no mms, hard text entry, no office document editing, no camera autofocus, no videorecording, no camer.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>settings,no memory slot, hard to transfere and share images and music, no usb mass storage, no radio, stereo bluetooth, must use itunes to transfer music, no hardware music keys, no custum ring signals,.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>htc shift good: has everything bad: huge (a small laptop).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>nokia e90 comunicator good: has everything bad: big, borderline ugly.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>sony ericsson w960 good: 8GB memory, stereo bluetooth headset, looks nice, touch screen, walkman.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>bad: no memory slot, low resoulution on that big screen, no hsdpa.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>sony ericsson p1 good: qwerty keyboard, card slot bad: hard qwerty keyboard, low resoulution on that big screen, borderline ugly, no hsdpa.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>To summerize this the n95 is a super phone beacuse it packs all features exept touch screen in a compact format but it falls away beacuse of short batterytime and low build quality and that it is a bit on the big size (just little to big.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>), iPhone is joke its just a ipod video with a nice screen and webbrowser and a phone feature it lacks in all departments, htc shift is amazing it realy is a super tiny laptop with touchscreen but you cant have it in your pocket and that is not acceptble, e90 has everything including a keyboard and .</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>sdpa in a small package I defenitly have to look at it in the stores before I buy w960 im just afraid e90 will look ugly and big in real life, p1 and w960 is the same phone diffrence is that p1 has cardslot and qwerty keyboard and that w960 has 8GB memory with no cardslot and a regular phone look a.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>d a music and finger oriented interface and bundeled bluetooth headphones, the p1 is kund of geeky and ugly in real life and the keyboard is way to unnatural to use so if I have to choose between them it must be w960.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>To summerize the summerization it stands between the e90 and the w960,  e90 has advantages such as full qwert keyboard, hsdpa, gps, exelent screen, allmost full laptop replacement.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But w960 has som advantages such as allmost normal phone size and normal phone looks and touch screen and bundeled stereo bluetooth headset.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Price is bound to be lower for w960 to.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So i guess it comes down to these questions:  Is money not a problem?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Do you want a real buissniess phone?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Want gps, hsdpa, highres screen?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Is it ok with a big phone that fills your entire pocket and weighs a bit and looks like a small laptop and looks a bit nerdy?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Then I think e90 is the right choice!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Do you want a phone that looks like a phone?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Do you want lots of buisnesiss features and touchscreen that is navigated both with fingers or stylus?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Is UMTS ok speed for your mobile surfing needs nearest 1-2 years?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Can you live without GPS 1-2 years?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Do you want to pay as little as possible for this device with bundled stereo bluetooth headphones?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Will you mostly use your device as a mp3 player and phone?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Then maby the w960 is more correct.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>(Remember n95 have much of what e90 have but with short battery time it disqualify itself before the race.)    Hope someone had benefit from this text.</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>The positive and innovative aspects of the N95 are out of question.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But let us focus on a detail that will become a great issue when the initial enthusiasm of getting the phone is gone - the batery life.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If the battery performance is like in N80 - it will be a shame.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I got a N80 last summer and was very happy of all its features, but the battery was draining every day, and when using a bluetooth handset even couldn't last from morning to the eveneing without a recharge.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I am afraid (hope I am wrong) that the situation with N95 will be close to its predecessor N80, a 970 mAh are obviuosly not enough for such device (compare with the Pocjet PCs, almost all of them have at least 1200 mAh and I wonder why Nokia did not take lesson from the N80).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So please post your comments on the battery life of N95 if you already have it, it is very important, because it clear than everyday recharge will be quite annoying for phone costing well over 500 euro irrespective of all its features and merits.</sentcont></sentence>

<sentence><sentcont>no more wobbles, no more creaks, no more loose slider, no more cheap plastic that easily gets scratched on n85.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>sound quality now is one of the best, support for a standard usb charging, more ram, better dual led flash, 3.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>5mm jack conveniently placed at the top, lock switch key on the right side as opposed to n91 n81 n96's inconvenient placement at the top, slimmer dimension, new screen technology that reproduces more realistic picture quality, improved user interface, faster processor, higher capacity battery, better power management.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>so everything is improved on n85.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>it's the perfect nokia slider.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>n85 starting price is same as n81's starting price so it won't be that much expensive compared to the initial price of n95, n95 8gb, n96.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>n85 is the evolution of nokia's previous slider phones.</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>Hello N95 Fans  I have used N95 before for 5 months.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Only difference you can see in New 95 is 2.8inch display instead of 2.6inch, Battery is 1200mah instead of 950mah.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>8Gb internal memory instead of 160Mb, No Micro SD Card slot, Weight 129gm compared to 120gm and 1mm length more.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Symbian OS 9.2, S60 rel.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>3.1 is same for both, so the software and application bugs will be same of old N95.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Application manager crashes N95 OS several times, this is a major Issue.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Keypad is a great disadvantage for N95, it get loosened so fast.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Mine is loosened in am month usage.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Same thing, the old keypad will be there in New 8Gb N95.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Design look too old.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Not Stylish.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Nokia have to compete for other good mobiles vendors.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I bought the Motorola MotoRockr E6 mobile last month.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Its too good mobile with enormous features.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Ofcourse the camera is 2mp, it takes a sharp image in outdoor.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Rockr has a business card reader, that scan n recognize the business cards and store into its phonebook.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Wifi is not there, but I am using wap in Opera browser more user freindly due to its touch screen facility.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Touch makes its user friendly as compared with N95.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Not even one time Rockr E6 OS is crashed for me.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Rockr's performance is far far better than N95.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It has 1000mah battery which gives 5 days battery backup with less usage.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>You can watch movies, songs mp3 in 64 channel output.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Movie quality in sound and video is amazing and superb and battery backup also too good.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>U can easily watch around 3 movies continously around 3:00 hrs each (total ard 9:00 hrs), still after u will get battery backup to another day.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Mp3 Playback of 14 hrs continuous.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Overall features are 2 times more than Nokia N95.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Once if u use, u will feel the difference, that why I am critising Nokia N95.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I am not campaigning you ppls to buy Rock E6, I am telling my view about N95.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Check Motorola MotoRockr E6 reviews.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Free to mail me if you have any doubts about both Rockr as well as N95  Regards  Kailas Senan  Larsen & Toubro Limited  Embedded System Software Engineer  Kailas.Senan@Lntemsys.com</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>Hello, I'm new in the forum and I would just like to say that the Nokia N95 may not be the perfect phone, like any other phone, it has its pros and cons.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So far, I've had no trouble with my N95, no crashing, no errors, even before I updated my phone to version 12.0.013,</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I've had no incident of those issues.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Yes, battery life is crappy, but you cannot actually take it literally when nokia said "It's what computers have become".</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This phone is a mobile device, with lots of features, it's only but natural that the multi features will eat up the battery of the phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If battery is your problem, always have a spare battery around, or bring your charger.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>As for the crashing and error issues, you may have to consider the fact that you bought a defective unit, sad but it might be the reason.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>also, you may be putting in applications that the N95 cannot handle (3rd party softwares).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I'm not bias, I respect sony ericson, samsung, and other brands, I've owned some of their "crowned jewels" like Sony P990i, and the unit proved its worth.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So, before you snap and further destroy your N95, take it back to your distributer, have it checked, and pray that its a defect and have them replace the unit.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>As simple as that...Thanks.</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>i agree wit u nokia master.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>i bought nokia 5300 last summer 2008 and it was gud and the only thing i dont like wit dat fon is dat it has sensitive LCD and a fragile loudspeaker.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>so i sell it and i bought a nokia 6300 coz it really catches my attention so much because of its stylish design yet i finally realized dat it was made from china.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>you can power on its bluetooth but bluetooth enable fon such as n70(bought in saudi arabia) can't detect my 6300.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>i wonder why does dat n70 had detected my brothers fon(sony ericsson k800i) so i sell it again to another mobile fone repairmen and i bought again a nokia n95 8g and sad to say it seems dat history repeats itself.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>at first i havent noticed dat ive bought a china made n95 8g.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>heres some problems dat ive encountered wit all new n95 8g of china.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>1) it doesnt have video call or 3G capabilities.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>2) it says hir dat it was already furnished wid an 8 GIGABYTES internal memory but its still slow.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>3) im looking 4 its GPS but i cant even activate it or even open it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>4) in summary: i cant find all those features related to a n95 fon.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>nokia 3310 is much better rather to buy a nokia china fone the only thing separates old 3310 from new n95 china fone is dat a huge LCD display, a camera, and a polyphonic tones.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>n95 china is just a larger version of 3310.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>i dont know if i should call myself such stupid why choosing dis n95 china fone but is der any such actions for dus manufacturers to minimize using names of original nokia?.</sentcont></sentence>

<reviewtitle>carry your computer on your pocket</reviewtitle>
<rating>1.0</rating>
<freereview><sentence><sentcont>Nokia's N95 superphone is complicated, taking days for even the most experienced gadget journo to digest.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>That's why lots of reviews I've seen so far are either extremely light or 10,000 word stunners: This is one of those long ones.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's likely easier to pore over the phone yourself in our hardware and software gallery walkthroughs, and come up with your own opinion.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But If you want the text heavy version, here's what's great and terrible about this phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Aside from call quality, why Nokia's N95 Rocks:1.GPS:</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The GPS is really GPS, not some assisted-GPS that Sprint and Verizon have in their phones.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>That means you can really navigate with it, like I did, to streets around SF I wasn't too familiar with.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>(Specifically, the corner of Washington and Cherry, close to where the Zodiac killer blew away a Cabbie so many years ago.)</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The point of interest database is sizable and you can search for things by proximity (the nearest ATM or liquor store), and then get the phone dialing right up.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Turn by turn is a subscription that'll cost you about $10 a month, and the voice nav won't read street names, but that, and the phone's persistant Lag aside, it rocks.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>2.Camera: I detect a decent level of grain in these 5mp shots, and the shutter lag is horrendous, but WTF, it's a 5mp camera with a Carl Zeiss 2.8/5.6 autofocusing lens in a phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>There are great controls for ISO, white balance, sharpness, contrast, and flash.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>And video comes in at 640 by 480 at 30fps.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Not shabby.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>And the editing programs are powerful, especially the photo editor's clip art feature.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Proof is in the pudding: Check out Flickr's N95 photos.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>3. Lifeblog: Like other N-series phones, this one can post any text/video/image you take with the phone to a blog.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I'm addicted to this.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This can be done through the Lifeblog software, which will combine text and images into a blog post on Typepad.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The phone will send pictures Flickr's API, too.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>(And via Flickr's blog API, can send photos to most other blog ware.) Right now, Vox is the only site that will accept automated upload videos.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But I'm willing to bet there's even a youtube uploader out there, considering the Symbian OS's dev community.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>4. Media Playback: The mp3/video player is fairly straight forward, and that's why I like it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The speakers are unreasonably loud, in a good way, for a device of this side - as loud as the Samsung K5 with external speakers - and there's an EQ as well as visualizations.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>File support includes MP3/WMA/M4A, and AAC support for those soon to be unlocked iTunes/EMI files.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The media playback buttons aren't the easiest to press, but they add to the simplicity and dedication this device has to AV. Add in support for Podcasts, even those of the video variety, and you're talking.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>(MPEG-4, H.264/AVC, H.263/3GPP, RealVideo 8/9/10) 5. Extras: I admit this is cheating on a list of 5, but all the little included apps really help bring the Nokia up.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>There are office document readers/editors, a standard convertor, calculator, zip utilities, GPS utilities, VOIP (Gizmo Project), a uPNP media server, and all your basic txt/sms/email/browsing/bluetooth, on and on and on.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Feature-wise, it is what a phone could be, given today's technology, minus phone carrier greed.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>(All in our feature walkthrough.)</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Why Nokia's N95 Sucks:1.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Battery: No matter what anyone says, the battery life on the N95 isn't good.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>You can justify it by considering how much power true GPS, WiFi, and those booming speakers take.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Even turning off 3G access, as you won't find reception in the US, the phone will be begging for DC after an 18 hour day of moderate/heavy use.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>2. HSDPA Europe only: This phone is a European variant, and its WCDMA 2100 radio can't tap Cingular's US band HSDPA.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So, you're stuck with EDGE speeds when you're not close to WiFi.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Here's a tip: Turn off the 3G support to save some battery life.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>And get used to using WiFi for the heavy Audio/Video Tranfers.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>3. Laggy OS: I don't know whether to blame Symbian or Nokia, but I don't really care, who's fault it is: This phone is sluggish.5.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Hardware Feels Junky:Two words: Fisher Price.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>They should have packed these components into a denser package.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The world's most powerful handset is also the thickest modern phone without a QWERTY.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But consider all it does, and the fact that its still pocketable, and you can over look its rather portly 0.8 inch thickness.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Full hardware rundown here.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>5. Price: $750 dollars is an unsubsidized price, and I commend Nokia for bringing this unlocked beast of a phone to the US without carriers who'll lock up both the SIM slot and the multimedia features.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But that's a lot of money.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I'd find that more acceptable if the GPS didn't require a subscription, the office software edited without buying an upgrade, and if the rest of my complaints were firmly answered.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>You have to use this phone for yourself (or go on through the walkthroughs below) before you spend this much cash on a portable computer/phone/thingy.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Even then, only the die hardest phone geeks and those who can benefit from the phone's liveblogging capabilities should consider it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>??</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>Hi guys.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I would like to give some different look on the comments of this phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I am still thinking whether go for this phone or not.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Besides I have some bad experience with N80 last year.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I played with a N95 of a friend of mine, but just for 2 days so I cannot make some solid conclusion based on such short experience.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So I am very cautious.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Let us try to make some objective and reasonable judgments in order to get a more comprehensive picture of the, let call it this way, "the real N95":).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Having read a lot of opinions here (I am following them from the beginning of the year) I would try to draw some of the main groups of problems giving some general or specific comments on cons.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Also to point out not only the weak points but also the strong and "innovative" features.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>(Because it can obviously be seen that the majority of posts here are totally opposite - one are saying "this is the best phone I have ever had", while the other are saying - "this is the worst phone, dont buy it".</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So let?s group the points of interest like this.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>1.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Battery life; 2.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The 5 MP camera; 3.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Video; 4.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The phone hangs; 5.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Problems during a call; 6.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>GPS; 7.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Music; 8.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Display; 9.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Robustness of the design.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>1.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Battery life.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The disappointing battery life was expected.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In the posts from January-February a very few guys were reporting the phone should be charged daily or even twice a day; because only few had the chance to use the pilot release and because the rest were dazzled by the specs of the phone and eager to get some kind "Lord of the phones" (there were such expression in a post here).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Nevertheless, having the experience with N80, everyday charge is something very boring.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Especially after elapsing the first one-two months when the delight of using such a complicated device is gone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The second battery partially solves the problem but still you have to pay to much care for that - always to have the spare battery charged, to replace batteries when the one in the phone is drained.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The other approach is to restrain from playing with the wifi browsing, or shooting videos if you are on the move during the day and cannot plug in the charger.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In a moment you start asking yourself - does the phone serve you or you serve the phone?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Or there are some ?tricks? to prolong the batt life - disable 3G, or reduce wifi sensitivity, or not to shoot to much, or not to listen to the music too much, or not use the GPS, etc - well, why should you buy such device if you do not use its features?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Someone here were giving the example with Ferrari - they say the Ferrari consumes too much fuel but still it is a Ferrari - ok the comparison is not that correct.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Fuel consumption is not the analogue of the power (battery) consumption though both are related to energy; here the issue is the USABILITY OF PERFORMANCE ?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>a ?fuel</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>hungry" Ferrari is giving its full performance to the user, but a ?power/battery</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>hungry?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>phone cannot deliver its potential to the user because it simply cannot last enough to give the overall performance to be consumed (?overall?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>means all features, not use only gps, or use only camera, or only make voice calls).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If you have a Ferrari, would you close it in the garage and drive it rarely ?on last Sunday of the month?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>or would you enjoy it everyday as much as possible - if you are happy with the speed and acceleration, etc of a standard car, why should you go for a Ferrari?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Right?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>However let?s gulp down this problem and take it for granted that we cannot have normal battery last in a ?multimedia?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>N-phone (?normal? is something between 3-5 days; or at least firmly over 2 full days (48 hours), regardless of usage of the features, OK?).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Of course some will say - well you have all-in-one device, so how could you expect longer time?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>OK, to that statement I would oppose the above mentioned question - do the phone serves you or you serve the phone?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>And what is better, to have 10 separate devices that are giving their full performance, or one single device combining them but giving you just one feature at a time of all these 10?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Is it a kind of philosophical question?:)</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>no it is a technical question - the device should support all the features it is designed to.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Again with the car analogy ? the car should perform as a car despite of whether you dirve it in the summer (hot) or in the winter (cold), or whether you drive it in a sunny day (no light, heaters, fans, etc) or in a rainy evening (with all electrical stuff switched on), Right?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So, in the end, there is no excuse for the poor battery life.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>2. The 5 MP camera.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It is clear that a phone camera will never be at the level of the current dedicated cameras.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So wheter it is 5 MP or 3.2 MP, it is almost the same.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Further more, it is welknown that Nokia still cannot reach the quality of the SonyEricsson competitors in the mobilephone cameras.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So do not expect the unexpected in this area.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>No need to go deeper in the subject, everything is clear I think.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>3. Video  Here I think we should give the deserved for the phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The feature of VGA video shooting is very very nice.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Again to expect hte quality of dedicated videocamera is irrelevant.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But compared to the CIF and QVGA resolutions in previous phones, the VGA video in your phone is quite usefull and handy.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>4. The phone hangs  Well this should be precicsely specified when it hangs.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>We cannot expect this phone to behave like a computer, desipte that it is equipped with a 330 MHz processor.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>At the time of the 300 MHz Pentiums we had not have so rich multimedia content, right?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In my N80, I couldn't open a pdf or doc bigger then 800-900 KB.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Here we also have 64 MB RAM, of whic about 20-22 MB free (as far as I saw when played with a N95).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Here may be the ad "a multimedia computer" plyes a bad joke for the users - remember this is not a computer, so do not expect to perform like a PC (how often your PC hangs when running some big or complex stuff?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>for me, relatively often the Windows Media Player or Real Player hang when starting a movie).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But the bad thing is that the phone realy behaves slow when opening the images/videos.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>that is something that I definately observed in my short test with the phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>5. Problems during a call (Noise or fuzz or buzzz or whatever during a call)  That is a serious problem (if present).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I have not noticed it but saw several posts about it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So pls say how many of you have noticed it in your phones.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>6. GPS  The chipset in N95 is a Texas Instruments one, not a Sirf III or RFMD, or not even a Sirf II.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So do not expect to have the performance of them.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Here the real problem is in the time to wait for lockon the satellites.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Waiting over 3-4 minutes makes the GPS a thoughtless feature.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Lot of people complain they were waiting 10 or even 15 minutes for "satellite signal".</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>(Me personally could not start the gps at all ...).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The other "problem" here is that the phone could not use the built in GPS receiver with third party navigation programs.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>On the phone I played with, I used a Holluv Sirf III GPS and connected it via Bluetooth to N95 and it worked perfect with TomTOm6.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But why is the built in GPS chip than?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Concerning the maps of "over 100 countries or so" - the idea of having all the info accessible from a app like smart2go in the Nokia is very good.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But still it is not yet fully-usable worldwide (apparently).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But still it is a very good idea so let us be more patient and understanding.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So about the GPS we may want a lot of improvements, both in the phone firmware and hardware and in the info database from Nokia.    7. Music  Playing music is better than N80.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>About the sound quality - I expected much better from the "stereo" speakers.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But if you plug in good earphones (not these coming with the phone) it is absolutely ok.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Again do not expect this device to sound like your home stereo.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>8. Display  Notably worse than in N80 - we have larger screen with smaller resolution in N95.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It is obvious when look on the very nice data given in the gsmarena.com</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>review:   Nokia N95 	40 x 53 mm 	240 x 320 pixels 	3,623 pixels/cm 2  Nokia N80 	35 x 41 mm 	352 x 416 pixels 	10,204 pixels/cm 2    9. Robustness of the design  Some people, also in the reviews, it is reported of noises when sliding the slide, or when pressing the buttons on the slide.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This is something that was present in N80 too.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But in N80 also the battery door on the back was loose, something that in N95 is amended.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>WHen we have a slide, it just could not be as robust as the bar.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If you were not bored in reading all this, I would ask you to help in trying to expand the list of problem groups.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In this way we can justify reasonably and get a clear overall picture of "the real N95" and not just to say - this is the a "crown", or this is a "rubbish".</sentcont></sentence>

<reviewtitle>Great phone, absolutely worth the $$$!!!!!!!!!</reviewtitle>
<rating>1.0</rating>
<pro><sentence>
<sentcont> Best display, tons of great & useful apps, best camera </sentcont>
</sentence></pro>
<con><sentence>
<sentcont> GPS maps should've been pre-installed on the memory card </sentcont>
</sentence></con>
<freereview><sentence><sentcont>Purchased N95 last week.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Before I used a 8801, N93, N80, 6270, 6280, Razr V3, Sony Ericsson w850i, e.t.c....too many to list.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>For those of you who are still wondering weather or not it's a good phone for the $, if you have an extra $700 - this is the phone to get.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It has all the features that the phone can have, excellent camera, GPS, e.t.c.Let me start with the camera.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I can only say positive things about it, since it provides excellent pictures not only outside, as many of other users stated, but in the dark as well!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The color balance is great.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Although I would wish some optical zoom...</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I took some pictures in a totally dark environment without any light - came out great!! This can really substitute for a digital camera, if you don't care about optical zoom.GPS needs upgrading.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I didn't find any pre-loaded maps, and you need a wi-fi connection to download them.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Speaking of which, i found wifi to be a great upgrade over the N80's first edition.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>N80 always gave me 'out of memory' errors whenever browsing the web, as I'm a heavy i-net user, working as an IT. On the other hand, you can see Nokia fixed it with the N95.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Only once I got that same error message, while having multiple apps running on the background, which is understandable with MP3 player, Real player, Snakes 3D, and browsing the web.The phone comes with the 'downloads' link, where you can download some nice free apps as well, such as antivirus, games, ringtones.Bluetooth</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>works great, I would suggest one to download an upgraded version of Nokia PC Suite (6.83 I believe) because it fixes many known bugs.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Mp3 player is great too, it comes with visualizations, so your friends will go 'WoooooooW'!!!!The battery life is desent for this type of phone with that many features.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Nokia once again upgraded the battery to BL-5F.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's a litttle bigger, but provides a much longer talking time over the other N-series.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Using the phone all day, playing MP3's for an hour at the gym, with bluetooth turned on all day long, it finally needed charging at night.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Finally, the video camera also doesn't disappoint.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The videos are great, although not DVD-quality like Nokia suggests, they are the best I've ever seen on a cellular phone, much better than on the N93i.One more thing I wanted to mention -- the phone is very well balanced, and feels great in hand.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I love the slider, eventhough it's not an 'assisted one', it still feels much better than over the worst sliding mechanism - N80.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The buttom row of buttons (* 0 #) is very close to the edge, which can make it hard for text messaging.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The number pad, on the other hand, has a great feel to it, so you don't have to look at it all the time while dialing (I txt message a lot, so had to memorize all the letters)).So, for thouse of you, folks, that are still wondering what to do with your $700...</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I think N95 is definitely worth considering.</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>hi PFQR,    SGD$1500??? only rich suckers will that kind of $$$ for a mobile.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I tested prototype set before, and it is sad to say it does not have xenon flash like K800 to take  night shots, or shots in low light condition.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The megapixels is just part of what constitutes a good camera, it is not everything?.N95 has no xenon flash or optical zoom !!!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The keypads is even more difficult to get used to compared to N73, which took me a while to get used to small keypads.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>You can easily mixed up the ?C? or cancel button, and the red colour disconnect button if you try to type fast.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The keypads is also very ?plastic?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>like, and hard to key on, wonder why nokia designed such a keypad?.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>N95.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>No xenon flash No optical zoom ( only has digital zoom, up to 10 x and VGA up to 4x ) Focal length of N95: 5.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>6/35 mm (35 mm equivalent).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>On the plus side, it has 3.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>5 mm audio output jack, TV out and the ultra cool dual slide design with a totally different user interface compared to other N series, which changes to landscape or portrait view when you slide to either direction.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Not to forget that it supports Wi-Fi., and has 5 mpg camera.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Overall, I would think it?s not really worth trading in my N73 for this???..although many people think other wise?.</sentcont></sentence>

<reviewtitle>1st Class Phone</reviewtitle>
<rating>0.9</rating>
<pro><sentence>
<sentcont> Great all-round device that does everything </sentcont>
</sentence></pro>
<con><sentence>
<sentcont> Slight delays when using some functionality </sentcont>
</sentence></con>
<freereview><sentence><sentcont>Having read the editor's review you'd end up thinking that the phone didn't look that good, have great build quality or respond well, and possibly also that it wasn't the best thing since sliced bread.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The truth is that this is one of the best looking and feeling handsets out there.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The build quality is very solid and it's snappy for all the key phone functions.Having</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>used every kind of handset ranging from the Palm based Treo to a multitude of Windows and Series 60 phones over the recent years they've all fallen well short of being an ideal phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This is the first one which genuinely starts to deliver the goods.The</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>overall feel of using the N95 is that it is simply phenomenal and without doubt is a milestone in mobile phone development.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I'm fortunate to be based in London and get to benefit from all the 3G goodness and speed, and have to say that the browsing, navigation (GPS) and multimedia goodies such as playing the games on my wide screen television make this handset an unbelievably useful and fun device.Other</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>great features are the performance for syncing, it used to take ages to sync a Nokia phone, but this one syncs faster than you realise, so much so, that I've set it to auto sync via Bluetooth whenever it's near my laptop.The 3G connectivity means that surfing and emailing through the PC or N800 are now a joy on the move as well as in the office.The</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>other thing to note is that the connectivity in general and especially the Wifi works extremely well.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The phone seems to instantly detect wireless networks, at least three or four times faster than Windows and allows easy switching between the wifi and 3G connections allowing you to save on your bandwidth bill.What is clear though is that some of the functionality is in effect 'back-up' to dedicated devices.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I'd always prefer to take photos with a dedicated digital camera although the camera works very well in good light (although it is slow).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The GPS (Maps) application is great and the ability to drill down into street level in villages in Hungary (where my wife is from and currently visiting) is something I've never found before in a GPS device.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I would still use my Nuvi though to navigate around most of Europe since it does a great job and has a bigger screen.This is also the first Nokia which is 'standard' in that it has standard headphone jack and USB connectors.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It means it actually starts to feel like a tiny computer rather than simply a phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If you compare the performance of this device with PCs it comes on top in all kinds of scenarios.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The multi-tasking nature of the N95 is also great.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It allows you to flick through songs using the dedicated keys, whilst reading a travel guide and plotting your route to the next destination, all to be gently interrupted by an incoming call with a 3D ringtone which zooms from one side to the other.Having looked at some of the reviews and my own experience, and compared them with the editor's review it's clear that the editor has got this one seriously wrong.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I can appreciate that there's a couple of disadvantages in using the handset in the US but even then the general performance should simply blow you away.There's no device that comes close to this phone as an all-round handy device which really works.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It certainly means I'll be carrying a lot fewer devices on a day-to-day basis</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>Hello Friends,  Please consider all the above few negative points before buying.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This is a truth for N95    No Touch screen?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I think Nokia is not confident in making touch screen mobiles or they want to make profit, anyway we are forced to use the old keypad.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>You cannot see the screen in bright sun, the screen get blackened make poor visibility even the display brightness is set to 100%.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Battery backup less than a day, if you use wlan/mp3.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If not using battery charge will last for hardly 2 days Application manager hangs the phones several times.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This is a serious issue, most of the customer doesn't know sis support not there.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>only sisx n jar support.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>No USB charging, only thr 230v supply, cannot charge ur cell from laptop.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>See Sony Errision & Motorola, how good in charging the battery using USB.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Bluetooth paring is too slow n transfer speed is too slow.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This is applicable for those who use bluetooth in data transfer You cannot transfer files via blutooth more than 160MB in old N95.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I don't know about new N95.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Camera lens is not covered in new N95, Old one have a projected cover.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Accumulation of dirt n getting scratch in lens area in ur precious 5 mp camera.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Accessories are too costly.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>keypad will get loosen very fast, no life for the keypad, nokia have to do some thing for this.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Without good keypad whatz the use of mobile.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Not user friendly for browsing net in wireless lan.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>keypad problem.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Poor battery life, depends on the usage above said.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>No option to kill the application, if the phone hangs, u need to remove the battery to reboot.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This is shame for all N serie.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Sim card is behind the battery.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Can't turn off the network when phone is switched on.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Advantage for  Motorola new series like Rockr E6. small keypad make it difficult in typing.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Calender entry is not as user friendly.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Battery backup only 2 days.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Talktime 4 hrs.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Mp3 only 5 hrs.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Call are getting rejected frequently when the buttons gets pressed inside the pocket, even the phone is locked.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Phone will dial itself in pocket, if it is not key pad locked.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Sliding get loosed so fast.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>mine was loosened in a month use.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Interfacing N95 with our pc/laptop is very tedious, It take time for both in bluetooth n thr USB.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Transfer rate through USB is slow.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Battery cover is too thin, the clip can get break easily.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Thickeness is more for this cell(21mm).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>TV out, audio output fails.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>video does'nt hva good quality in TV Out.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>FM Sound output is too low.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Bass Boosting is not good.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>U will not feel the boosting in bass.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Overall feature ratings are poor.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I will rate 6 of 10. Need more features like Business card reader, Office editor, USB charging, touch screen, FM stereo output.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Office word will not show pictures n tables, No power management feature, Video flickers and drags in night mode, slow bluetooth n USB tansfer, No body think that you will clear pictures always in its 5 mp camera, its not a digital camera, its a mobile.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Why am telling this, I have compared Sony 5 mp digital camera pictures with that of N95 5mp pictures.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The picture clarity is for Sony's 5 mp cam though one picture size is 4.5MB jpeg, whereas the picture size of N95 5mp picture is 800Kb max in jpeg (less than 1MB).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Here it goes, the jpeg picture quality is reduced if the picture is compressed less than 1 MB. N95 could retain the actual picture quality rather goes for image compression loosing the jpeg informations.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>There is no option to vary the compression or settings to improve the picture quality with increase in size of each captured image.</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>This is -almost- an amazing phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's so close to being great, but it misses out on a few important things.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>First, there's the battery.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Even with all the features like bluetooth turned off and the phone on the lowest battery use possible with just a regular user's calls and text usage you'll be lucky to get two days out of it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Considering many phones these days have batteries that last more than a week, it's just not good enough.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I understand that a complicated phone like this will drain the battery more, but most people don't care about that and require more than that.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Second, the sat-nav.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's a great feature to have on a phone, and kudos to Nokia for being the first to put it into a popular handset.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But, it's buggy.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It can jump from place to place, it doesn't flow smoothly, it's slow to load, and getting the maps loaded and updated is a hassle.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Plus there's not enough space on the phone really to store all of that.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Third, the memory.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>A handset with a 5MP camera and built in sat nav not coming with a large internal memory or a decent sized memory card in the box just doesn't make sense.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I can understand how they want extra money through accessory sales, but when you market a handset for certain purposes it makes sense to give the customer the full package.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's an expensive phone with impressive features.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If only there had been that little bit more care put into it.</sentcont></sentence>

<reviewtitle>All your dreams...in the palm of your hand</reviewtitle>
<rating>0.9</rating>
<pro><sentence>
<sentcont> WiFi, GPS, Bluetooth 2.0+EDR, Symbian OS based, Map application, large screen, dual slider, intuitive user interface, 5MP camera </sentcont>
</sentence></pro>
<con><sentence>
<sentcont> Battery life poor, but it is fine w/ a nightly recharge, not made of anodized aluminum </sentcont>
</sentence></con>
<freereview><sentence><sentcont>This phone does everything imaginable.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's pretty much a full computer in your pocket.Camera:5MP is phenomenal for a cell phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It also has many advanced functions such as aperture settings, exposure compensation, white balance, self timer, and red-eye flash settings.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>On top of that, the video camera is very very good but not DVD quality as Nokia says.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It even has image stabilization built in.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In other reviews, you may have read that the "camera was slow" or something along those lines.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The truth is that the shutter itself is not slow, but the response time between pushing the button and the clicking of the shutter is long.GPS: Really useful and neat feature to have.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Be sure to clear all maps first using the PC map loader (if it was not bought in the US--mine was an Asian model) Then load your US maps into the memory card.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The map goes down to street level and is fairly up-to-date.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The accuracy of the GPS is around 150 feet.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It even indicates altitude and speed of your vehicle.Video/Music Playback:The media centre of this phone has some impressive animation, and plays videos and songs in stereo sound with impressive quality.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Plus, it can be hooked up to any TV so you can blow it up on a larger screen.WiFi:Fairly good.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Regular sites don't load as fast as a normal comp, but that's because of the overall processing power/RAM of the unit.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>WiFi also saves you on expensive data costs that you would prob encounter with your wireless carrier.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's really useful for checking email and browsing your favorite sites.Bluetooth:The</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>EDR really helps when you sync your media files from your computer.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It also helps increase the range between your computer and the N95.User interface:The Symbian OS is very intuitive and clean.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Occasionally, it lags but this wasn't a big issue for me.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Even more complex apps like the Map application loads and quits efficiently without hanging up.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The unit only freezes after applying a more complex setting such as changing the system theme or something.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It can be fixed by a simple restart of the device.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>However, this should've been fixed by Nokia through a simple message telling you to restart your device the way you'd restart your computer after installing an update or program.Battery:This</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>seems to be a big point of critisism for the editors and other users of this phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The honest bottom line is this: it doesn't go about 14 hrs without a recharge.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>(that is w/ use of WiFi, GPS, and Bluetooth).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If you use the phone just for talking w/ idling, the battery lasts a comfortable 21 hrs.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The best thing to do is to probably charge it overnight daily.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Then you'll be fine.PDA</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>functionality:The address book, calandar, and document viewers are excellent.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Multiple numbers per contact w/ room for email addresses, home addresses etc.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The calandar has many options for appts, meetings, and alarms.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The document viewer not only opens regular text docs, but also spreadsheets and some kind of file that resembles PowerPoint.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Checking email is also easy as setting up your account with the wizard is a snap.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It works of WiFi or through your wireless carrier.Screen:The</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>size is really nice and the important info such as time, date, etc show up nice and large so it's easy to read.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>For videos and the GPS, it's perfect.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The ambient light sensor works well.Physical</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>feel:The phone has a solid feel.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's also slimmer than it looks.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>When I saw the pics on the Nokia site, it def looked thicker than when I actually had the unit in my hand.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The fact that the sliding mechanism isn't assisted isn't a big deal for me.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The two-way slider is also pretty neat.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>However, the slider, when open, has a slight flimsy feel to it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's also made of plastic, and not anodized aluminum like a lot of new electronics (eg.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>iPod) which is surprising for such a high-tech device.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The plastic is wrapped tightly and solidly around the device though and doesn't "squeak" or "creak" when being handled.Overall, this phone is really THE THING as it surpasses the typical smartphone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Despite a few minor faults, it is an amazing device with tremendous functionality.</sentcont></sentence>

<sentcont>Limited use of US "3G" </sentcont>
</sentence></con>
<freereview><sentence><sentcont>I'll make this short and sweet.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I was waiting 6 months for this phone to come out.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I've owned it since the 2nd day it was available in Europe and it was everything I wanted and more.I have intergrated my life into one device.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>My work mail(exchange) and my g-mail work flawlessly.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>All of my appointments and to-dos are synched with my MS office client and now i never miss a birthday, appointment or flight.The</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>GPS is perfect for getting around town and thus far I've used it in Washington DC, Baltimore, San Francisco, Philly and NYC.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I never get lost anymore!! Oh and if you plan on using this phone get the proclip for your car...it will save your life!!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>You can either look up locations by address or if it's featured in the in-phone database.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Don't be unrealistic when looking up addresses with this phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Like any GPS you have to be practical, you can't just follow it blindly and expect to be exactly where it tells you.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>You can also save landmarks for future use, so if you're at a location you want to find easily again you can just save it on your phone and find your way back their easily from that point on.Swear to god the phone weighs less than a pack of cards and a little more than a pack of cigarettes.I work for a VoIP provider and have gotten the Internet Calling to function and it's fantastic.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Nothing beats bypassing the cell phone carrier and calling France, London or Japan for pennies.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Or being at London Heathrow and being able to call home from and internet Kiosk and to everyone backhome it's a local call and costs me nothing!!I could get into the camers but that would take forever and I've alrady praised this phone enough now for the cons.Firstly the battery life is pretty short.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This phone needs to be charged at every oppertunity.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Realistically it's got too many features for it not to be a power vampire.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I'm sure the engineers at Nokia could have doubled or tripled the battery life but then the device would not maintain its light weight.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Between Wifi, bluetooth, camera, GPS, a bright and sharp screen that will light up a dark room, this device has a real world 12-24 hours of use before needing a charge.People are also very disappointed that it doesn't have a touch screen like the iphone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Again I'm pretty sure this relates to power.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>That would just be another featre that would shorten it's lifespan.People</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>compare my N95 to the IPhone all the time and I lay it down for them.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>My nokia blows the Ipohone out of the water 8 out of 10 times.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The only features that the IPhone can boast over the N95 are the touchscreen and the beautiful screen.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But you are comparing apples to oranges.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The IPhone is 80% media player and 20% cell phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The Nokia is 20%laptop 20%camera 20%GPS and 40% cell phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If you want an all in one device, can tolerate charging your phone every chance you get, and don't mind having to one finger your typing...this phone is for you Any questions?</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>Till today I have never had the courage to name any phone like the best one on the market with clear conscience.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But Nokia N95 does deserve this label.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It has no adequate competitors on the current mobile market: it is extremely rich in functions, has a comfortable and detailed user interface with plenty of settings, and on the top of it, it is a relatively light and compact.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The most notable drawback of Nokia N95 is its battery life.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It will require daily doses of power, unless you limit its usage to occasional calls and messages, deactivate 3G, Wi-Fi, and GPS, and play no videos.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In this case you may happen to postpone charging by a couple of days, but is such use worth the purchase of a phone like Nokia N95?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The answer is no.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Of course, battery life is an individual matter and depends on many factors.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Nevertheless we can assure you that during our intensive tests we had no other option but to charge the device sometimes even twice a day.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The first batch of Nokia N95 hit the market at a high price.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Even so it was immediately sold out.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The main delivery whose price is said to be a bit lower is being expected at the end of April.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Anyway, the price remains rather high, perhaps due to the strong customer demand.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Nokia N95 may be very expensive, but it also offers a lot and thus keeps attracting numerous prospective buyers.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In this sequence of thoughts it is quite probable that in a few months, when the initial ecstasy falls off, the price of the phone will also fall down a bit.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Be prepared, however, that drops in price will hardly be significant as Nokia N95 will continue to be the best phone in the world for a while and will thus manage to easily maintain its price.</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>My Nokia N95 satnav GPS experience was a nightmare.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Nokia recognises that it has a problem with its GPS satnav hardware and have come up with the "assisted GPS" idea.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The problem was that I found the assisted GPS was fine if you were in the city, but once you got into the countryside, rural areas then it became a problem once again.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Assisted GPS is their work-around to poor GPS satnav eqipment.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Assisted GPS is NOT "true" satnav.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Rather than getting the signal directly from the satellite (as in your cars satnav system), assisted GPS gets its positioning by using ground base stations (Nokia says that it gets it's initial positioning by using these base station and then connects to satellite, I am skeptical of that, I'd love to see their proof of this).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I'll tell you what happened to me & my Nokia N95 (maybe it was just MY phone that was faulty??),    Without assisted GPS the satnav capabilities of my phone was zero.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>With Assisted GPS, the satnav at last started to work quite well.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But it was a false dawn, because although in the city all worked well, I wanted to see what happened when I was in more remote areas (country lanes & on a mountain).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>what i found was that the GPS satnav was useless.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It would not find the satellite and location.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I ran it alongside my cars satnav.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Whereby the cars satnav pinpointed my position wherever i was in the countryside, the N95 failed dismally.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>After all that hope i was back to square 1.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>There equipment must be flawed?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Look at the evidence?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Why would they come up with assisted GPS?    following on from above........</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The Satnav On the Nokia N95 didn't work, so i sued Nokia through After 30 days there was no response from Nokia and the court ordered them to refund me ?300....Heres my case sent to www.moneyclaim.gov.uk "Goods "not fit for purpose".Claimant</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>purchased a Nokia N95 mobile phone with GPS satnav.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>At no stage did the GPS work properly.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The Claimant contacted T-mobile(sellers)who informed him that responsibility laid with NokiaUk.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Nokia offered many fixes&advice on various software updates and patches &other ways to correct the defect(e.g</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>"assisted GPS").</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Many hours (hundreds) were expended over several months followingAdvice but to no avail.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In Nov2007 the defendant informed the claimant that nothing further Could be done&the claiment took this as an admission that the product was "not fit for purpose".</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Prior to purchase the claimant researched the manufacturers specs (nokia.com).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The phone was purchased from T-mobile (In-house sales line).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>TheClaimant made it clear to the salesperson that he only wished to purchase a phone with GPS capabilities.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>He was assured that the GPS would be effective.During the same call the purchase was made.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The GPS proved innefective and the claimant now seeks a refund of the costs incurred with this purchase"</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>GOOD:??The Nokia N95 cell phone boasts a 5-megapixel camera that produces good-quality photos and videos.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It comes with advanced multimedia capabilities and has a 3.5mm headphone jack.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The Symbian smart phone also features integrated GPS, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth, and an innovative two-way slider design.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>??BAD:??The N95 lacks support for U.S. 3G networks; standby battery life is poor; and performance is somewhat sluggish.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The hardware feels a bit cheap, and the sliding mechanism could be more secure.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's also very expensive.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>??BOTTOM LINE:??With a 5-megapixel camera, advanced multimedia capabilities, and GPS, there's no doubt that the Nokia N95 is one of the most feature-packed smart phones to date, but poor battery life and sluggish performance make it hard to justify the high price tag.</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>Nokia N95 is the best mobile phone so far.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But let me point these out.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>According to many reviews, 5MP pics taken by N95 is no match to those 3.2MP pics taken by N93/N73/K800i due to too much JPEG compression in N95's shots.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>N93 (not N93i) takes an overall better video recording than N95/N93i.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>N93 records video with the same 30 fps MPEG4 (like the N95/N93i), but in "stereo" AAC audio encoding.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>N95 (as well as N93i) records in "mono" AAC audio only.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The reason - the N93 has 2 separate microphones.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The N95/N93i has only a single microphone used for audio encoding.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In music playback, N95's audio quality (headphones-wise) is no where near N91.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Reason - N95 is a "music-capable phone", not a "music phone"!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Technically speaking, N95 cannot produce a very sweet, rich & clear sound like the N91 mainly because the N95 doesn't have what N91 does have - 2 dedicated audio chips installed in its hardware namely, ASIC N2200 & N2000.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Of course, you can't have it all.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But overall, Nokia N95 is sure the king of all mobiles!</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>I grabbed my n95 day of release, thrilled to think that one year ago the rumours that were being spread of an n83 had truly been turned into the actual n95.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>now i'm having seccond thoughts...was it worth my $1254 aud?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>yes i know i cbf shopping around.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>firstly, gps- so slow.... takes me about 5 minutes to conect to sat.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>although i've never used another gps system, i am guessing this is not normal.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I have heard other people complain of this too, but they say it gets quicker with time.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>loading google maps is good, but the onboard mapping system is just as good i think.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>i've found google maps requires you to have internet connection to be able to see the actual map(so great if ur in a wifi area.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>but bad if u don't have cheap gprs connections...) anybody know a workaround?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>onboard mapping software allowed me to see where i was without connection to network.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>although i was driving 15 minutes away, it took 5-8 minutes to connect to sat.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>to get coordinates and then after another 2 mintues of fumbling buttons to set destination and start trip calculations, i was about 200 m from destination (i had to park because i wanted to see it in action!!!)    so when it was working it seemed fine.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>but, as other people have found, voice nav.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>requires $$$$ and it came up with an annoying statement etc asking me to subscribe.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>imagine i was really lost, there goes my $ subscribing to year of nokia maps.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Actual phone is a bit of a letdown, lags, resets itself randomly (4times in 4 days) keep pressing menu button by accident instead of left or right arrow key.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>so what i have big thumbs.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>camera lags when on 5mp mode.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>havnt tried any other mode.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>but its about 2-5 seconds b/w pressing the button to take pic and actually seeing the image on screen of ur final pic...strange.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>on n95 screen, pics seem a liiiitle grainy...    wifi keeps dropping me out.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>well, this may be due to my network, and i hope it is for the n95s repuation... but it really shits me.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>downloading videos off the included reuters links, get dropped out from wireless...    3.5mm headphone jack is great.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>great sound quality, i personally believe (although i havn't heard it through a good pair of headphones) inbuilt speakers have an amazing ability to project themselves...and also have an amazing ability to split ear drums with high pitched onboard nokia tones...argh!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Battery life is the other m a j o r letdown.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>with using wifi maybe 5 minutes, gps on my 15 min car ride which turned into 20 cos i stopped to play with gps, about 5 minutes of normal call time and 5minutes of bluetooth call time and about 3 minutes of speaker call time, my battery is wailing for a charge as I type.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>-i have not got more than one day with propper use of functions without either needing to charge or noticing it was on one bar and thinking it would die tomorrow if i listen to mp3.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Although I knew what it's size was before I got it, i still miss the slim 8250 in my pocket.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>god i love that phone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>=P    So after closely following rumours and exclusive reviews posted all over the net, desperately awaiting the device that is not just one thing, it's many.... i've almost convinced myself its not worth the price.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>ALMOST.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>-happy with reception (as you would expect fomr a high end phone)  -dual slide ability is fantastic   -screen is awesome, colorful, bright biiiig...  -music playback is to me ipod comparable (well i have 3gipod,time for new1)  -inbox equipment is more than generous.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>nokia included 1gb in the box and shop gave me a free 2gb...so thats sweet.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>inbox case is pretty protective and stylish...although i have worries about camera safety.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>~my zeiss optics!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>IS N95 WORTH IT??? DOES IT LIVE UPTO THE HYPE???  well, i'll leave that up to you to decide, i still can't decide.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>basically, i think, if you have the means, get it, but if ur jobless like me...don't waste all your money on release date!!! haha -but its damn sexy.</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>wow thanks for the compliment sir dani hehehe.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>sir lattroteuse, sorry to hear about your unfortunate experience about nokia and the n95, hopefully they will sort it out.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>maybe you can file a complaint at nokia.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>com.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>?.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>dear sir arepeaceDNA,.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>first you can only turn off the camera sound completely if you have a euro1 euro2 or balkan firmware version (just turn the "warning tone" off).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>if you have an asian one or from the U.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>S.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>you may not be able to turn off the sound, there are ways to reflash your unit to euro1 or euro 2 or even balkan firmware though so you can turn the camera sound off.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>or you can just download the application "ccam" it lets you use the camera with no camera sound nor red light.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Quite cool hehehe just search it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>its a free application btw hehehe.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>btw.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>if you have firmware 20 and above, you will notice a significant improvement of the battery life and the super speed of the phone overall ehehe.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>in my case I use my n95 extensively, so I kinda charge it every night.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>my battery is depleted once I use the phone for 6-8 hours.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>used for gaming(most of the time), viewing videos, and using the camera etc.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>and if your phone doesnt vibrate even when its on.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>i think you have a defective battery.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>sir gana,.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>you have every right to change your phone to whatever you choose, If it will make you feel better to change your n95 for an n82 then by all means please do so and you are entitled for your opinion, You can say that n82 is superior(which in some factors, crucial to others, yes it is ).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>but n95 holds its own against n82, minute details that makes the n95 worth considering compared to the n82.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>in terms of flash, xenon is bar none definitely the most powerful and most suited for photography, but using the xenon flash extensively.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>drains the battery big time.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>and in macro or close up scenes.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>there is a high chance you'd get overexposed pics because of the powerful light of xenon.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>whilest on the n95s case, the modest light that the underated led flash emits is really good at macro and closeups, AND you can use it extensively at close intervals in between usage unlike xenon.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>and n95's led flash is one of the most powerful led flashes around beating that of the dual led flash of w960(google it).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>n95 has a bigger screen you can toy around its construction as it is dual slide with bigger and more keys.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>has infrared not as useable for file transfers as bluetooth but you can use it for certain applications such as tv remote.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>motion detector etc has a comprehensive video editing suite on board the phone (which the n82 nor the n95 8gb doesnt have).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>to some, n95 has an edge in form factor over the n82.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>to some n82 is just too classy to compare it to the n95.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>ultimately its your choice no one is stopping you from going with what you want.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>but to n95 users.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>apparently n95 is "the phone" and is simply the better choice.</sentcont></sentence>

<sentence><sentcont>6 to 8 months they come out with a much better phone what were the downside with the n 95 will be fixed on this it is for taken.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>by firmware updates you can fix the software problems what abt hardware problems they must have been fixed for sure.</sentcont></sentence>
