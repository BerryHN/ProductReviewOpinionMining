<sentence><sentcont>Photo gallery: Apple iPod Touch (third generation)Photo gallery:Apple iPod Touch (third generation) Now in its third year, Apple's iPod Touch has evolved so many features and uses beyond media playback that we're not really sure what to call it anymore.</sentcont></sentence>

<reviewtitle>Most revolutionary iPod since the original</reviewtitle>
<rating>1.0</rating>
<pro><sentence>
<sentcont> Gorgeous and durable screen, sturdy build and amazingly slim form factor, intuitive interface, many features yet still easy to use, stellar battery life, app store, high memory capacity, speedy and reliable OS, web browsing is AMAZING </sentcont>
</sentence></pro>
<con><sentence>
<sentcont> A bit pricy for high-end model, no sd card slot, no built in microphone for some apps, back scratches easy </sentcont>
</sentence></con>
<freereview><sentence><sentcont>The new iPod Touch is the most amazing ipod yet.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It has corrected the build from the first generation, and is extremely slick, yet sturdy.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Although the mirrored finish scratches easily, you will most likely put it in a case.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The screen is really vibrant and makes it amazing for watching video The media player aspect of the ipod touch is off the charts.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The coverflow is extremely slick and fast, and the album art is beautiful to look at.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The genius feature, along with the downloading of music on the device makes this iPod the most music friendly yet.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The video player is fast loading, and it looks really good.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The browsing experience is off the charts.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>although you can only connect over wifi, it makes the experience more pleasurable than 3G because its way faster and more satisfying.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The built in applications are top notch, and the email is very cool to have.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The app store is amazing.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The built in wifi makes it extremely easy to get applications, and the amount of free apps is staggering.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>And the OS is clean, quick, and barely ever crashes.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The only issues I have with this device is that the back scratches extremely easily (but a case will fix that), there is no microphone for cool apps like shizam (but if you have headphones with a microphone it will work), and no sd card slot (but the capacities are as high as it goes for flash, so memory shouldn't be a issue).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I know the price is slightly high, but the features justify its price.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Overall, the iPod touch is the crown jewel of Music players, and if your looking for a device that will be cooler, slicker, and more feature packed then any other music player out there, then the iPod touch is for you.</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>Touch comes to iPod.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Introducing iPod touch.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>iPod touch features the same revolutionary interface as iPhone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Built to take full advantage of the large 3.5-inch display, the multi-touch interface lets you control everything using only your fingers.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So you can glide through albums with Cover Flow, flick through photos and enlarge them with a pinch, or zoom in and out on a section of a web page.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>And iPod touch features a touchscreen QWERTY keyboard perfect for browsing the web in Safari, searching for videos on YouTube, finding music on the iTunes Wi-Fi Music Store, or adding new contacts.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Ambient Light Sensor The iPod touch display has an ambient light sensor that automatically adjusts brightness to suit the ambient light in your surroundings.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The result?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>A better experience for you and battery-saving efficiency for iPod touch.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Accelerometer An accelerometer detects when you rotate iPod touch from portrait to landscape, then automatically changes the contents of the display, so you immediately see the entire width of a web page, your music in Cover Flow, or a photo in its proper aspect ratio.</sentcont></sentence>

<sentcont> Sound Quality Georgeous screen touch interface Wi-Fi Apps Apps and Apps Mail Sync Safari </sentcont>
</sentence></pro>
<con><sentence>
<sentcont> Not compatible with several 3rd party chraging docs (not completely apple's fault here)  Built in clock with alarm - (only plays from pre-designated alarm sounds)...seriously, this is an iPod</sentcont>
<sentcont> Copy and Paste feature missing </sentcont>
</sentence></con>
<freereview><sentence><sentcont>After not being completely happy with the purchase of the latest generation nano, I returned it and threw some extra money down for this 32 GB iPod touch.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Considering what this does with the Apps I purchased, watching movies, and listening to music this is a bargain.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Music Player - The controls for browsing through music is excellent and apple has seemed to trumped itself on what was the biggest selling point of previous generation iPods (user interface).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Flick to scroll, press on letter, auto-orientation of videos, sorting features and seamless integration with iTunes makes this the best music player ever.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If add song lyrics to the mp3 file, when the song is played, the lyrics are overlaid on top of the album art...and you can scroll through the lyrics.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Videos - Look great, have watched full length movies?no</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>eye strain.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Apps expand the functionality to limitless possibilities, it has turned what is an excellent mp3 player into a:  Alarm Clock in the morning- using the built-in in clock of the ipod (granted you only can play the preset alarm sounds, hopefully apple will change this to allow playing from a playlist).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Large jump drive - Air Sharing is an app that allows you to have your iPod appear as a shared drive on your computer.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>To put files in just drag and drop.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I has the ability to view many file formats PDF, Excel etc...  Calendar - Syncs multiple calendar and appointments in them.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Alerts you to upcoming appointments.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Safari - Great mobile web browser head and shoulders above the competition  Contacts - Sync from multiple contact sources (outlook, Gmail, mail)  Remote - Serves as my remote control not only for my itunes playlist, but setting up on friend playlist, I'm able to remotely browse their songs and play music through their computer.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Photos - Sync specific folders of iPhoto always have your latest pictures on you to be able share with friends.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Notes - take random notes on the fly  Dictionary - this has replaced my home dictionary (Recommend Oxford American Dictionary with built in thesaurus)  Calculator - As an engineer and HP RPN fan- mathU RPN is the only calculator I'll ever need.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Use Graph Calc to plot complex 2D and 3D equations.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Level - nice app serves as a level in a pinch  Engineeing Reference - Apps like Steam, Elemints, Elec Toolkit, ChemCal and Equivalence have all the reference tools that have previously taken up several books and were cumbersome to look up.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Fitness - Nike+ built in, tracks your running, iStayFit for logging my gym workouts (weights and cardio), WeighTrack for tracking the ever battle of the buldge, iCook for creating healthy recipies with abilitiy to add custom ingredients.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>PocketFirstAid - Good reference tool in the event of an accident.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>News Source - USA Today App, NY times APP, Stocks tracker, Sportacular, FoxSports update daily with the daily news and sports.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Games - OH My, a lot of fun entertainment.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Careful if you take your touch with you to the bathroom, someone may think you've fallen in.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>HeavyMach, Stratefic Assault, Chopper, MIA, Days of Thunder, Rebel Onslaught...the games are pretty cool, and new ones are coming out that are even better.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Entertainment - Latest movies playing in your area app, Pandora, Netfilx, YouTube  Kids Educational - Math Cards are great form my 8 year old to practice her time tables, She also loves KidArt.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Portable Kindle - Reading with this is surprisingly enjoyable, no need for a night light anymore - Apps like Classics and Kindle make this a great reader.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>and there soo much more...  Everything this thing does make it the one indispensible gadget I have in my home.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I take it everywhere</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>I had purchased my first generation Touch a week before this new second generation was released, but I was able to return it to my local Target.Physical</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>SpecsThe entire front is just a beautiful, big, 3 in.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>screen.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>There are only three buttons, a small circular home button on the front, useful volume controls on the left side, and a power button on the top.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It is only 8.5 mm thin, 4.3 in.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>in height, 2.4 in.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>in width, and 4.05 oz.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Although thicker than the first generation, the contoured edges and curves, it feels even thinner and feels better to grasp.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>On the back there is Apple's signature aluminum backing that wraps around the front for a nice chrome bezel.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I was disappointed at first for replacing the nice dark rim, but the new rim is thinner and looks better than the iPhone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>On the upper left there is a newly shaped Wi-Fi antenna.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It is shaped like a oval and is more attention grabbing to me.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Although you can see yourself with the reflective backing, after a week of use, you won't be able to.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Even putting it on any surface, the back will gain a couple scratches.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Coupled with the greasy smudges produced by your fingers, the backing is a sight for sore eyes after a month of use.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I suggest an invisible shield.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I remember watching scratch test videos online for the indestructible first generation screen.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I was amazed.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I was soon amazed with the screen so I never put a screen protector on.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>There were no scratches.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Unfortunately after a week I got the second generation iPod Touch, there was already a scratch.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>No biggie, right?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's very small and all, but if you go to a bright graphic, it clearly deteriorated the screen around it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The home button also has a much cheaper feel.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The click feels completely different, and the sound it produces does not sound good.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>On the side there are volume controls that are quite helpful.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Unfortunately, they are not very easy to click.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Interestingly, if the iPod is switched to landscape mode, the volume controls don't switch with the direction.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In other words, when tilted, the left volume control would raise the volume, and the right volume control lowers it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I wouldn't think of it as a bad thing though, just personal preference.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>At the bottom there is a USB connector for syncing and charging, and one headphone jack.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>There is also an internal speaker that seems to have audio coming from the USB connector.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Software and PerformanceWith a mobile version of OS X, it is just like the iPhone without the phone features.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Released with the new product was software version 2.1.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Everything is done by navigating with touch, and is very simple and fun to use.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Multi-touch is also possible on the BEAUTIFUL screen made of glass.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Audio is average by headphones, but only if the dreadful provided earbuds are replaced.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The internal speaker doesn't sound like complete crap, but is so quiet, the only way to hear it is to have no ambient noise.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Video quality is beautiful and sharp.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Movies, TV shows, and music videos can be bought from iTunes at reasonable prices.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>An Application store was released from software version 2.0, and allows further customization with applications such as games, utilities, and many other possibilities.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Official game licenses release games, like EA, THQ, and Namco.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Games are full-length, and sometimes look very nice.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The Accelerometer is sometimes used to a fun advantage, and touch is mostly how everything is done.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Applications range from many types, such as: Books, Business, Education, Entertainment, Finance, Games, Healthcare and Fitness, Lifestyle, Music, Navigation, News, Photography, Productivity, Reference, Social Networking, Sports, Travel, Utilities, and Weather.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Unfortunately, developers of these applications can only configure things inside the application, and nothing to change the actual operation of anything outside the application.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>These apps definitely make this a deal-maker.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Battery life is very good, rated life of 36 hours of audio, and 6 hours for video.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>There are also preloaded applications, such as: Mail, Calender, Clock, YouTube, Photos, Weather, Maps, Stocks, Calculator, Notes, Contacts, The App Store, and the iTunes Store.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>All do what their names inform you of.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Safari is very useful, but only if you have a Wi-Fi connection.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Mail is just POP or IMAP email that is OK, but is not viewable by landscape.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>YouTube is just YouTube, but doesn't feature EVERY SINGLE video.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Although I'd say 99% of YouTube's database of videos will be found on this Wi-Fi application.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>iTunes Store is a Wi-Fi music store, and the App Store is the mobile Application Store.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>ConclusionIf you have the iPod Classic and have the money, I would still definitely recommend this media device.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>With so many features, I wouldn't consider it as just an MP3 player.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Although it does have some build faults, I REALLY recommend the 2nd generation iPod Touch.It is a totally unique iPod with a plethora of features, combining simplicity and innovation to a revolutionary level.</sentcont></sentence>

<reviewtitle>Much more than an mp3 player!</reviewtitle>
<rating>1.0</rating>
<pro><sentence>
<sentcont> Can't live without it, Does everything!, Can access the internet, Sleek, Easy to use, Fun </sentcont>
</sentence></pro>
<con><sentence>
<sentcont> No camera, Scratches easily., relies on router too much </sentcont>
</sentence></con>
<freereview><sentence><sentcont>First of all I will provide some background info about myself.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I live in a small town (between 5,000 and 6,000 people).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I also have a 19 month old toddler.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I'm planning on buying a membership to the local gym to help get rid of my post pregnancy tummy and tone up my muscles.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>That's what started my obsession with the iPod touch.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I need music to listen to while I work out so I began researching mp3 players online.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I did A LOT of research and I finally came to the conclusion that this is the best product for your money - especially if you want an item that will do it all.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If you just want something to play your music, then this isn't for you.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But if you want something to play music, videos, view photos, play games, read email, go online, access your contacts, tell you about the weather, and many more things...then this is your music player!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Now, I'm not rich - far from it!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>And I don't have any credit cards or anything like that.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So I was deffinitely freaked out by the price.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I bought mine for $225 from a licensed Apple retailer.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I was tempted to buy from ebay but I've gotten some bad products from sellers who had decent reputations.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So, needless to say, I was a little leery.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I'd rather spend more and get a product that is guaranteed to work and won't be "lost during shipping".I only purchased the 8gb model.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I'm not planning on downloading any videos to it and I don't have a huge mp3 music library.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But if you want to download videos or movies onto the iPod's memory or if you have a huge music collection, I would deffinitely suggest getting a model with more memory.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I sometimes wish I'd bought the 16gb model but I think the 8gb will be sufficient.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>As for the iPod itself...all I can say is WOW.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It is absolutely amazing.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It can do everything that the iPhone can do except it doesn't have the phone part built in and it doesn't have a camera.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So it's perfect for people who WANT an iPhone but aren't on the AT&T network.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I use my iPod as a music player, an organizer, a scientific calculator, a weight loss tracker, a GPS direction device, an encyclopedia, a game console, a weather checker, an email checker, and to access the internet.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>And there are more applications you can download (many are FREE!) to turn your iPod into something else.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I've seen apps to turn your device into a leveler, social networking apps...if you can think of it, there's probably an app for it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>You can even access the iTunes store and pay for and download music directly to your iPod.It's only shortcoming is that you have to have wireless internet to access all of the features.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Wireless routers aren't too expensive so it's not a big deal but it does kinda stick for those people who would have to buy one.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>And you have to have internet access to hookup your router as well, if you didn't know.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>A cable connection is best.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>My router goes up to 400 feet and it cost me about $40.When I bought my iPod, I was afraid that the apps would be expensive and that I'd be tempted to buy a lot of them.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>However, many of them are free.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>A lot of the free apps are considered "light" or demo versions - but they're almost as good as the ones you have to buy.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The only app I payed for was a game and it cost me 0.99.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I have an app for wikipedia, The Weather Channel, Lose It! (a weight loss helper), WebMD, Solitaire, and a couple games.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>There are many free apps that are useful and entertaining.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>For example, you can get apps for MySpace, FaceBook...you can even download an app that will help you make VoIP calls from your iPod (with the help of a headset with mic.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>At first, I did wonder if I'd spent too much on a glorified mp3 player.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But after using it in my day-to-day life, it was worth it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I don't regret it at all.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I can actually check my email if my daughter is awake - I can't with my computer (a laptop) because she tries to grab it and push buttons and it's too difficult.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I can easily check directions if I'm having trouble finding something.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I can look up phone numbers and information online if I'm trying to find a product that I need to buy but can't find it in stock.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I can check symptoms with WebMD.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I can organize my life with the calendar.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I can do my homework with the scientific calculator.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I can listen to my music.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I can listen to audio books.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I can do pretty much anything with this device!It really is worth it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So if you've been thinking about buying one for awhile and you're still on the fence - just do it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>You won't regret it!A lot of people think that it sucks that you have to use iTunes.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But you don't have to buy the music from them!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>You can use Limewire or whatever and then just add it to your iTunes library.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It does scratch easily but that can be solved if you buy a case for it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I bought a hard shell case - the front part is aluminum and the back is clear.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It also comes with a screen protector so that the touch screen doesn't get scratched up.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's worked well for me so far.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>My only issue with it is that it doesn't have a camera.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I think, for the price you pay, it should have at least a 3 megapixel camera like what most cell phones have.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But other than that, this is a great little device and well worth it!ALSO: If you are having problems accessing your Yahoo! email account from your touch, this is what I did to fix my problem.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I kept getting errors saying that the account couldn't be verified or that my username and/or password were incorrect.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>First, delete the yahoo account info by going to settings->mail->account->delete.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Then turn off the iPod buy holding down the sleep/wake button until a red slider pops up.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Slide the slider.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Go online, LOG OUT of your yahoo account.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Turn your iPod back on and enter in your email account settings again.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>You won't need to repeat this everytime you need to check your yahoo email on your touch, just the first time was enough for me.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Just make sure you log out online or you won't be able to view it on your touch!If you are having problems with your YouTube app running, you may need to return your iPod to the store and get a new one.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>My friend could NOT get hers to work no matter what she did and when she got a replacement iPod, it worked fine.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It may just be a flaw in the device.If</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>you are having problems with iTunes, make sure you don't have any proxies running in ANY of your internet applications, especially Internet Explorer.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I use Firefox and had no proxies running on there, but I guess proxies were on my Internet Explorer so I was having all kinds of connectivity issues.Hope this helped someone!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If I have any more tips/tricks I'll add them later.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I did NOT buy mine online but you can find this product at many online retailers (Amazon, Apple Store (Free engraving), PC Connection (cheapest)) and in many brick-and-mortar stores (wal-mart, Target, Kmart, etc)If you have any questions about this product or about my review, please let me know!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Leave me a comment or send me a message and I'll get back to you asap.</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>What can I say about the Ipod Touch?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Well first let me tell you what it is.??</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It is an interesting addition to the ipod collection by Apple company that has many new features that are quite usefull to all.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>First and foremost, it has a touch screen.??</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This touch screen is absolutely wonderful in terms of capabilities.??</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>You can type on it through an in screen keyboard,?? you can navigate around the organized menu and applications.??</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>You can do all kinds of things.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Second, it has a fantastic Wi-Fi receiver built in each Ipod touch which has surprisingly good reception that provides pretty speedy internet for all your browsing and surfing needs.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Want to watch a movie?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The ipod is perfect for you because the screen is so large; about as large as the average person's palm actually.??</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It is very easy to coordinate as there are fast forward, rewind, play/pause buttons, and others.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Music is prime.??</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>You can download all different kinds of album art and hold your own gallery of albums with the Ipod touch.??</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>And added with a very manouverable song list/ artist list, all your music needs can become reality with a touch of the screen.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Applications are universal.?? Itunes has an uncountable number of apps for the Ipod touch.?? Headline news, sports, games, pictures, you name it!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Everything is on there.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I'd say that the Ipod touch is a very wise investment of money.??</sentcont></sentence>

<sentcont> easy to find music alphabeticaly, easy to use, great screen, lots of features, lightweight </sentcont>
</sentence></pro>
<con><sentence>
<sentcont> internet doesnt always work, only offers music downloads on iTunes, no ac charger with unit </sentcont>
</sentence></con>
<freereview><sentence><sentcont>I purchased the ipod touch as a Christmas present and was amazed at the capabilities of the newest ipod.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The screen is very awesome and the amount of music that the ipod touch can hold is quite amazing.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It is very easy to find music in the alphabetical list of artists, songs, or albums.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The ability to simply touch the screen is phenomenal and the first of its kind in mp 3 players.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I would recommend this ipod touch to anyone who likes to listen to music??because this ipod stays charged for a very, very long period of time and it holds 8 gigs of music or video.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Another added feature to the ipod touch is the ability to access the internet and specifically youtube.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I think there might be some kind of deal going on between youtube and apple because I do not think that the youtube icon on the home screen is fair.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It seems as though apple is advertising a lot for youtube.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The way the screen will shift from vertical to horizontal when the device is turned sideways is also pretty neat.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Not many mp 3 players have the capabilities of the new ipod touch.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I think that the ipod touch is likely the most advanced yet simple and coolest mp 3 player on the market to this day.</sentcont></sentence>

</sentence></con>
<freereview><sentence><sentcont>I have to admit that there have been few items that have captured and kept my enthusiasm for as long as the iPod Touch.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Two years ago, I purchased the original Touch, last year I upgraded to the 32 GB, and now I have the 64GB version.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Was the upgrade worth it?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>And what are the things yet to be imroved?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Because even though the Touch is close to perfection, there are still many small things that can be improved.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Hardware Physically, the new (64GB) Touch is identical to it's 2nd generation brethren.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's polished crome backplate is slightly curved, making it fit your palm perfectly.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>As before, the fact that it's made from polished chrome will guarantee that it attracts fingerprints and scratches almost magically.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I'm no friend of any kind of protective covers, and my last (32GB) Touch had to live in my pocket with my keys, coins, and other stuff I threw in with it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>After a year, the backplate did pick up a lot of scratches, and I expect that the 64GB to fare no better.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Personally, I would have preferred a brushed finish for the backplate.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This may have caused problems with the readability of the customized engraving that Apple applies to the Touch on the backplate for no additional charge (a nice 'touch' that becomes increasingly important as the Touch becomes more ubiquitious).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This custom engraving you can only get if you order the Touch through Apple (it's also not available in the Apple Stores).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The front plate is made from one of the most impressive glass enhancements I've ever seen.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>After a year of heavy abuse, my old Touch's glass front has not a single scratch - not one.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I don't know how Apple does it, but this is really impressive.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Remember, I don't use any protective covers or films.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The screen itself is brilliant, bright, and can easily be read outside, wich is a feat in itself.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The Touch has an ambient light sensor, so it can dim the screen when the surroundings are darker.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This time around, the screen's color temperature has remained unchanged (the 2G shifted all colors from a blueish to a more golden tinge).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Movie playback is simply astonishing.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The image is crisp, and the on-screen controls natural.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Again, there are niceties such as double-tapping the screen to change aspect ratio, or placing bookmarks etc.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>You still can't set a movie's contrast, but beyond that small issue, movie playback is perfect.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Viewing movies on the Touch simply works great, but personally I think that the screen is too small to watch a full movie.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Last week, I tried watching a TV episode while on a plane enroute to Hamburg (a 75 minute flight), but quickly decided against it, opting instead to play a game of 'Luxor'.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Somehow I prefer a larger screen for consuming video, while I have no problems doing something interactive on it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Still, video plays great on the Touch.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Button and interface lay-out has remained the same from the last generation: volume controls on the left side, top holds the 'exit/on' button, buttom has dock and phones connectors, and the front holds the single home button.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>There is one thing that can be improved here: I would have preferred the audio connector to be on top (or either side), as the current configuration precludes the use of many applications (e.g. News- and eBook readers) when you want to place it upright -- for example in the Gym.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Some apps do use the accelerometers and can be used positioning the Touch upside down, though.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The built-in speaker is unchanged from the last version.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's weak, tinny, mono, produces horrible sound, has no volume to speak of -- and yet it's one of the best additions to the Touch (the original didn't have it, the 2nd gen did).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It simply makes casual gaming so much more fun.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I don't care about the bad sound quality, I just love the fact that it's there.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The signatory white earphones that Apple sells with the Touch may look good, but I don't like them.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In my ears they are too uncomfortable.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Since I'm no audiophile, I can't comment on their audio quality other than that it's good enough for me.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Anyway, I replaced them with my favorite non-Apple version.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The hitch here is that Apple now delivers the 64 GB (and 32 GB) with earphones that sport a built-in mic and remote.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>And my head phones don't have that.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>While the remote is nothing much to write home about (the way it works is just too complex), the mic works well, and has just the right fidelity to pick out voice over the background noise.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>So, for now, I keep the white buds with me in case I want to use the IP-telephony capabilities.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Battery life appears to have been reduced somewhat from the 2nd gen - at least on paper.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>During the past few days the new 3rd gen Touch certainly performed as well as or even better than my 2nd gen - but then again, that one's battery is already one year old.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>One fact that I've become very fond of is the quick-charge ability, which works really well.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The built-in wireless connectivity is really nice, with astonishingly well executed integration.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The touch does all it's wireless networking over WiFi and Bluetooth.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>WiFi works really well (especially here in Switzerland where Hotspots are particularely dense), and Bluetooth integration (which I tried on the 3rd gen for the first time) is flawless.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>WiFi reception (range) lags somewhat behind that of a Wintel laptop (no doubt due to the metal backplate) and is pretty much on par with that of a 15" Macbook Pro (which is also somewhat lacking in WiFi reception range).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>WiFi is still the 'g' variant though [interestingly enough, the built-in hardware does support 11n, but so far Apple has chosen not to activate it, presumably to conserve battery.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This is interesting also from the fact that in the 2G Touch, Apple initially included Bluetooth capabilities, but only activated it with a later OS release.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Perhaps the same can be expected for 11n].</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Bluetooth now also works with headphones and BT-based car integration kits (works well in mine).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I would have loved to try out BT-based printing from the Calender or Addressbook app, but hit a snag: it appears no Touch app supports printing.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Missing Hardware There is some hardware that I expected, or whished that it was included in the Touch - especially as (some) of them are now present on other iPods: No camera.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I was somewhat ambivalent about this.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>No camera means no pictures and/or movies.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But it also means that I can keep handling it rough, as I do not have to worry abou the lens.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Also, I don't have to worry about taking it to the Gym (my Gym has very strict rules towards camera-equipped items).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>All things being equal, the addition of a camera (still and/or video) would have been nice, but I don't miss it much (truth be told, I yet have to use the camera on my mobile phone).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Unfortunately, there is also no built-in mic.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This is much a more significant omission than having no camera.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The Touch is a first class audio voice recorder and (more importantly for me) a first class Skype client.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>There are third party solutions for this (a mini-micro that directly plugs into the headphone connector), but if the touch had a built-in mike, it would make using world-class applications like Shazam (and Skype) so much easier Likewise, there is no compass, nor a GPS receiver present in the touch.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I understand that these are left out to better differentiate the Touch from the iPhone, but I would have welcomed them in the top-of-the-line (64GB) version of the iPod.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>And, finally, there is no radio receiver.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I'm definitely not a radio man, as I next to never listen to it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Still, some people do (as the ton of nicely selling IP radio applications shows), and anyway, the Nano has it now - even with a nice Tivoesque pause feature!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Why not the Touch?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Strange design choice.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Internet While by itself the iPod Touch is an impressive and fun device, it comes into real swing when connected to the internet.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The always-on nature and graceful handling of connection drops make the Touch one of the best internet devices I've used to day.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The included Safari internet browser performs great - unless you try to load Flash-based content, which is not supported.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The email client works great for receiving and viewing mail.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Writing anything but the shortest of email is annoying, as the Touch is simply too small for comfortably entering any significant amount of text.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Calendar and Address Book are well executed (even if entering a new date and merging multiple calenders is slightly more convoluted than necessary).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Mail, Calendar and Addressbook can (if you have that service available) synch live to either mobile me (which Apple loves to sell you) or Exchange (which your employer loves to force on you) through a feature that is very similar to 'push' notification.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In the past, using Exchange has been somewhat spotty, and mobile Me has had it's own share of problems.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>All in all, though both work nice, and exceedingly quick.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>You do need to be in range of a hotspot for this to function, though.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Somewhat disappointing is the fact that notes are not synched.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Another nice addition is 'Voice Memos' which is an audio recorder.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Had the Touch an internal mic, this app would have been even better... Applications Next to the 'productivity' or 'PDA' suite (Mail, Calendar, Contacts) the touch comes with some other nice (but somewhat dull) apps (e.g. Maps, Stocks, YouTube) and two killer Apps: iTunes and App Store.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>While the former gives you instant access to all songs and movies that are currently available on iTunes (Warning: that, plus the incredible 'Shazam' can lead to unintented gross music spending), the latter (App Store) gives you equal instant access to an incredible number of applications that you can instantly download and use.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The quality of applications on the App Store is quite uneven, and tends to cluster around some rather puerile topics (as a veritable, uh, heap, of Fart applications proves).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>That being said, there are a number of jaw-droppingly good applications that are able to utilize the touch interface (and other capabilities such as accelerometer) in new and surprising ways.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Just to name a few are the aforementioned 'Shazam' that can identify a song being played and instantly link to iTunes (you have to see it in action to believe it), Flight Control, where you manage an airport by drawing the flight path for each plane.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Bloomberg that provides stock information in an exhaustive way, and Wemlin that shows an up-to-date timetable for when the next tram arrives at my station.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>No matter what, there probably is an application that supports you with it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>And then there are games.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Apple had quickly recognized that the Touch represents an immensely attractive and powerful game platform.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Performance, screen, connectivity and control capabilities make it the ideal casual gaming platform.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Accordingly, games represent by far the largest category in the App store.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>While inevitably there are some truly awfully executed, or simply dull games, the majority of the available games are at least somewhat entertaining, while some rival and exceed those that can be had for thrice the price on dedicated gaming platforms.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In the past, my Touch quickly filled up with app after app that I simply couldn't live without any more, and an unforseen limitation of the Touch's design surfaced: app management.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Applications are arranged as icons on a 4x4 grid per page, with multiple pages that you can flick left and right to navigate.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Unfortunately, re-arranging apps, although possible (and quite ingeniously implemented) is still a chore.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Apple has done the right thing, and integrated a much nicer app manager into the (PC/Mac) iTunes application.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Speed Improvement The iPod Touch, although seen by some as the 'iPhone's smaller sibling' was always either as nible as the phone, or even faster.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The new, 3rd gen Touch is said to be 'up to 50% faster' than the previous generation.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>To be honest, I'm not sure that I see that speed improvent translate to much performance increase.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>That may be due to the fact that my Touch seldom maxes out on processor throughput or (for example when browsing) that WiFi bandwidth is the limiting factor.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Some apps appear to be 'snappier' during start-up (smaller apps) or execution (games, mostly), but all in all, the Touch pretty much seems to be as fast as the last generation.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This leads me to believe that the real bottleneck is it's internal execution memory (i.e. not the 64 GB storage, but processor memory), and ony applications that are specifically written to take advantage of new technology (e.g. OpenGL ES).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Or in other words: the overall speed has not been improved that much.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>SDK So you want to be a geek?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Already are?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>You can write your own applications for the Touch if you like.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I've taken the plunge and downloaded the SDK.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Note that you can download the SDK and develop for the Touch/iPhone without actually owning one.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The development system comes with a iPhone simulator that you can use to test your applications without downloading them unto an actual device (it does have some limitations: for example, the accelerometers are not simulated, and you have no indication of the true execution speed).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Well, you do need a Mac for this (although it can be a few years old).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The SDK is impressive - overwhelming even if you are not used to Mac programming (and almost prohibitively complex if you are not used to frameworks like Cocoa and object-oriented programming).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Still, crunching out your first (very basic) appliction is surprisingly easy, and if you roll that way, you'll get addicted quickly.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Summary: It's the killer personal entertainment device.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Buy it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>You know you want it -- especially if you have read this far.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>If you have the 2nd gen iPod, you may need to ask yourself if the slight speed bump and the additional storage is worth the hefty price tag.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>To me it was, but your mileage may vary.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>pros + world class touch/gesture interface + best iPod audiovisual experience around (music, video, photos).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>killer feature: app store and application availability + killer feature: internet integration (browsing and push technology) + great movie playback.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>really good casual gaming device + slightly improved speed (allegedly, only for some games) + great integration with mobile me (calender, mail sync) or Exchange.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>really good SDK if you are geeky enough to roll your own apps cons - no built-in mic (headphones do have them) - polished chrome backplate (I would have preferred a brushed finish).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>no gps, camera, compass - no radio (nano has it?) - no sync of notes, no wireless sync of music/movies.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>- spotty voice recognition in languages other than english - no control over downsampling of photos - no search function for music inside the iPod app - no visualizer.</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>This past Christmas my husband and I decided we were going to buy our 15 year old son a new ipod.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>He has had an ipod nano for two years and it was full!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>At first, we purchase the new ipod nano with video watching capabilities.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>When my husband brought it home, the screen was so small, there was no way you watch anything.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>We changed our minds and purchased the ipod touch.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The look Christmas morning was worth the little bit extra we paid for the ipod touch.</sentcont></sentence>

<sentence><sentcont>The ipod touch is extremely user friendly (even for mom's that are not technically savvy)!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It has provided hours of entertainment.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>On the downside, when you purchase the ipod touch, it does not come with a wall charger.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>You MUST purchase this separately.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>You can find these everywhere.</sentcont></sentence>

<sentence><sentcont>This can initially be confusing when you are used to pressure-sensitive touch-screens, and can become difficult when using the virtual keyboard.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The touch-sensitive font plate has (so far) proven to be scratch-resistant (i've been carrying it around in my pocket for the past three days).In</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>my hand it feels surprisingly hefty (sonsidering it's sleekness), and it is noticeably longer than the Classic.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Like most other iPods, the Touch has a polished backside that magically attract fingerprints.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This backplate also holds the customized engraving that Apple applied free of charge to my iPod.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The headphone connector is on the bottom, and accepts any normal headphone jack (unlike the iPhone).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The position of the connector would have been annyoing if you wanted to use it upright in a gym (natch, iPod nano!).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But movies are viewed in landscape orientation, and the iPod's interface automatically detects it's orientation.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Now that's design for you.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The earbuds are the same that come with other new iPods (classic).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>They are ok, but unlikely to be your first choice.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I use the those earbuds for running (with my shuffle), but third-party (B&O) earphones with the classic and touch.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I'm no audiophile, so sound quality usually is good for me (this holds true for all my devices).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But then, according to some people I'm only listening to trash anyway.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I therefore recommend that you look at other reviews if you are in search for a tone perfect device.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I like it.Controlling the iPod is a strange - great when you are looking at it, annoying if you can't see it (i.e. if it's in your pocket).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>As with all touch-interfaces that have no tactile feedback there is no way to 'blindly' control it, and sadly the Touch does not have a remote nor real buttons except 'sleep' and 'home'.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The Touch desperately needs some hardware volume control.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Looking at the screen I have to say that I am amazed at the clarity of the image.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>3.5 inches is still too small for me to comfortably watch a lengthy movie, but the 320x480 pixel wide-screen display is stunningly crisp.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I re-ripped some TV shows that I originally ripped for the Classic and watched them on the Touch.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The problem is that files ripped for the Touch's resolution are roughly twice as large as for the Classic - but the Touch has only a fraction of the available storage.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Thus, I can't envision myself using the Touch for lengthy movie watching - but it is excellent for watching shorter clips (while I'm no youTube fan, I do have a lot of short clips shot with my handheld camera).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The Touch's sceen is very bright - I can't confirm initial reports of 'inverse black' or other artifacts.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It appears to have a light sensor built-in that dims the screen when in darker surroundings, and brightens the screen when in the sun.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>One small annoyance though: there is no way to control a movie's contrast.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The docs claim that the Touch can play 5 hours of video on a single charge.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I'm prepared to take this on face value - I'm certainly not going to stare into that small screen for so long just to verify this.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's long enough for one-and-half normal movies, but won't last a transatlantic.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Nor would my eyes, though.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Coverflow is drop-dead beautiful, and a real show-off.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It requires that you add artwork for all your CD-ripped tunes, though.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Otherwise missing covers are replaced by generic grey ones.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's a great way to browse your music if you don't know what you want to hear next.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's a silly way to look for a particular album, though.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>For this, however, you can still (luckily) use the normal artist/album/song browser with the (again drop-dead intuitive) new gesture-based interface.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It works reall, really well.Like all iPods the Touch can play a large variety of file formats with the (expected) exceptions of WMA (protected and otherwise) and Ogg.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I don't have to add that it plays AAC protected (iTunes).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It can also display an impressive array of image and movie formats, even though I have the suspiction that some of the listed formats are transcoded on-the-fly by iTunes during sync.The Touch provides video out signals that can be set to either NTSC or PAL.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>For Europeans like me this is very important, but may be of limited use for people living in the US. What *really* annoyed me was the fact that Apple chose to change the video out cabling, and thus forced me to purchase new cables to connect the Touch to TV sets or beamers.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>WiFiThe Touch has 802.11b/g (but not 'n') WiFi built-in that can connect to the internet through normal hotspots.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Since you can expect the iPod to be in many different locations, hooking it up to hotspots is an important feature that must be easy to use.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The Touch can (and will) remember hotspots it has connected to, and asks when it connects to a new hotspot very much like your Laptop does.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Connecting to open Hotspots is a snap: scan surroundings, pick from list, (enter password when protected), connect.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>You can turn it off for airplane travel or to conserve battery life.You connect to protected hotspots (using the virtual keyboard for password entry).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Also you can use Safari for those annoying web-page-to-enter-billing-info based hotspots that hotels seem to like (and every one else hates).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Connecting to a closed and secure WLAN is a bit more complex.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>My WLAN is configured to require any device to be known by MAC address, and looking up this info wasn't as intuitive as I thought it would be (I found it in the Info tab).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I then entered Network Name and Password, and a few seconds later, my Touch had access to my WLAN.But what is so special about WiFi?</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>To me, having access to the Web is a killer feature.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I'm not talking about music here - but access to Google (but not the Google Apps just yet), Wikipedia, CNN, Amazon, and my web mail account.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>With just a little tap on the screen I can look at news, check my mail, track a package, fire off a note to someone, or answer a silly question that just entered my head.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Anywhere, anytime (when in range of a hotspot.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In Switzerland that's practically everywhere).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>To repeat: this is a killer feature.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It turns this digital media player into a nearly fully fledged PDA.The Touch version of Safari is great (even though Google Docs does not yet support it, and there currently is no support for Flash), and very responsive.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Using the virtual keyboard takes some time to getting used to (again the missing tactile feedback is annoying).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Navigating the web is quick (provided you have a good connection), and using the gestures to move the obscured parts of web pages into view becomes natural after only a few moments.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Summary:The Touch is (currently) the best flash-based media player around, with a stunning (even revolutionary) new gesture-based user interface that works.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I would have welcomed a significantly larger main storage, but it's very good as it is now.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>As a media player it's main drawback derives from the purely touch-based interface: it could have profited from a tactive rotary controller for 'blind' control.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The feature that separates the Touch from the rest is the addition of another killer feature: WiFi web browsing.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>WiFi based music purchase is a nice bonus.The</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Touch also comes with a number of (sometimes artificial) limitations that I hope will be resolved in the future.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>All in all I'm very, very satisfied with the Touch, even though the Touch experience can clearly be improved (e.g. by removing application restrictions, being able to pull in shared iTunes Libraries, sharing songs wirelessly, syncing wirelessly etc.).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>PLUS- great "video" iPod- WiFi web browsing with Safari (killer feature)- wide range of supported file formats (audio, video, images)- great display- phenomenally sharp images- drop-dead gesture/touch interface- both NTSC and PAL video out (important for us Europeans).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>- iTunes store wirelessly- TV PAL and NTSC out MINUS- no playlist groups- difficult to use 'blind'- no contrast control for movies- no disk mode (huh.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>?)- non-standard AV connector (again!)- artificial limitations on Calendar application- no Mail, Notes, Games applications.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>can't access iTunes shared libraries on WLAN- can't share songs with other Touch iPods- no wireless synching.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>16GB can be awfully small when ripping movies for Touch's resolution- no WiFi iTunes PodCasts By C.</sentcont></sentence>

<sentence><sentcont>??I also had some ipod videos and they loaded quickly and played great.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>??The new ipod touch has built in speakers which work great but the availability of Ipod docks is great and some are not too expensive and some are expensive but they make the ipod sound like an incredible stereo system.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>??The ipod is light and is easy to find and change songs with the touch of a finger while other MP3 players are hard to put music on and you can not change to the song of your choice very easily.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The Ipod touch is by far the best Ipod I have ever owned, but if you do not have the money for it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Apple seems to have one that fits every budget they are no more expensive than those third party ones that only synchronize with a PC.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>so I say Buy the best it will last a long time and they have great technical support as well and a great warranty that can be added called Apple Care where if the battery goes bad they would even fix that under that protection plan.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>??I have had Ipod touch from the first generation to the most recent release and all have been great.</sentcont></sentence>

<reviewtitle>Amazing device</reviewtitle>
<rating>0.7</rating>
<pro><sentence>
<sentcont> The large touch screen, so pretty</sentcont>
<sentcont>=D Also, great user interface, customizable, wi-fi, external volume controls</sentcont>
</sentence></pro>
<con><sentence>
<sentcont> Occasionally freezes, fingerprint magnet, lack of Flash in Safari, no microphone, not-too-great sound quality</sentcont>
</sentence></con>
<freereview><sentence><sentcont>More like a mini-PC than an MP3 player, the iPod Touch is definitely worth it (unless all you seek a simple, basic music player).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>You'll find yourself using it every day for everything from its intended purpose to social networking via apps to killing time with a game of Solitaire.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The touch screen is simply amazing, the wide variety of applications makes it incredibly customizable, and the entire device is just... amazing.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The wi-fi connection is among the best features of the iPod.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It enables you to download music and apps on-the-go, without a computer, which is a major plus.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Safari works incredibly well, and is a much better browser than the mobile versions found on, say, the Blackberry.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>However, Flash is a much needed addition, some fonts don't work (that's just me being nitpicky), and the size can be a bit small.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>(Holding the iPod landscape helps a little with the size issue, though.)</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Using wi-fi, Safari, and other apps in general is also makes the battery run out faster.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I've had some problems with the screen freezing up, but it doesn't last for over a minute and occurs very rarely.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The screen itself gets oily easily, which is a bit of a drawback -- but nothing a bit of cleaning can't fix -- and the back attracts an insane amount of fingerprints and scratches, so it's a good idea to get a case for the iPod.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Also... I've heard some static in my music -- I'm not sure if it's the earphones, the songs (it tends to only pop up in certain songs), or the device itself.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>And it's only noticeable when I listen in the dead silence of 4 AM -- so it's not a huge issue.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>In a perfect world, the iPod Touch would also have a microphone, possibly a camera, and a better quality speaker.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>But the world isn't perfect, and the iPod is still a great device that's worth buying.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>(&Random side note: I love the clacking sounds the touch-screen keyboard makes.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>xD)</sentcont></sentence>

<reviewtitle>good, but don't go for it if you have the older version</reviewtitle>
<rating>0.8</rating>
<freereview><sentence><sentcont>Before i start let me just tell you "what's New" with the iPod touch Third generation" : -Faster Cpu/Double the ram/Better graphic (faster Boot time/faster loading is all what i did notice) -Double the storage for the same old price -Voice control (I'll explain it in a second) -Latest firmware for free -New Earbuds with built in remote+Microphone (So you can use voice control) And that is everything~ depends on your needs upgrading from 2G to 3G might be not worth it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>*Important Note* : only the New iPod touch 32GB/64GB are third generation ~ (8GB is repacked 2G) Details below.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>About the new Voice control function, if you love to take your iPod with you to the Gym the new feature "Voice control" is pretty cool.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>it does allow you to control your music via your voice, no need to get the iPod out of your pocket you can simply say "Next" to move to next song, say "shuffle" for shuffle , say "Pause" and music playback will stop etc.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>that is why i recommend the iPod touch over iPod classic for gym users, my friend bought an iPod classic and now he complains that the iPod classic is too heavy for him when he goes to the gym and he will have to buy another iPod "properly Nano" for his Gym.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>for me i use my iPod touch for the gym, it's so light that sometimes i forgot that it's even in my pocket.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>After playing with my iPod touch 3g for a while i honestly did not notice any difference from the outside or the inside compared to my old iPod touch Second generation.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>(It's supposed to be faster but i did not notice anything during music and video playback or the menus.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>however browsing with safari and loading facebook was faster, same thing with boot time), you properly can only notice it being faster with heavy applications since video/music playback is already fast enough with 2G.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I got the 64GB iPod 3G for [.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>]$, if you think of upgrading your 2G iPod touch honestly do yourself a favor and save yourself the money unless you really need that much of a storage (I do that is why i bought one).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>also remember that the 3G battery lasts less than 2G,(3G battery = 30 Hours of music playback versus 2G 36 hours of music playback according to apple official specs) *VERY IMPORTANT* for the people who wants the new 8GB version.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>the new third generation 8GB iPod touch is NOT 3G it's a second generation iPod touch but apple did repack it/renamed it to 3rd generation, which seems to be misleading by APPLE and it's not cool at all, it is IPod Touch 2G+Updated firmware and that is it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The iPod touch 3rd generation 32GB/64GB versions comes with a free mic+remote with the earbuds while the 8GB do not (it comes with normal earbuds).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>the 32GB/64GB have the New CPU+Graphic (According to apple the new cpu is twice as fast just like the iPhone 3GS) while the new 8GB use the same old CPU/Chip from the old iPod touch second generation.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Here is APPLE description on the iPod touches page about the 32/64GB versions : """Enjoy all the great features of the 8GB model along with better performance, richer graphics and voice control""" The iPod touch 3rd generation is the same awesome iPod touch second generation was.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>You can play your music/watch your videos/play games, even read your kindle books/etc "you can read amazon big description of what it's capable of if you do not know yet, it's better than what would i say because it has pictures and everything.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The iPod touch got the best browser i have ever seen in a portable device, i do not even need to carry my netbook with me anymore thanks to my iPod touch, if you hated browsing with lame browsers that crash a lot or slow (many mobile phones) trust me on this one.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>the iPod touch browser is not a toy or a gimmick it is a browser you can depends on, it's super fast and smooth and after using it for like a full year it has only crashed on me once!.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Short list of pros and cons about the iPod touch Pros: -Slick,small and light device -Great touch screen.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>-The BEST web browser on a portable device -Amazing video/music playback -App Store (Too many cool applications for Free).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>-Display screen is clear and bright -No bugs and annoying stuff a very reliable hardware -64GB Flash based mp3 player.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Cons: -Not much of an upgrade over 2G (people were disappointed because they did not get upgrades like camera/OLED/etc).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>-Weaker battery, only lasts 30 hours for music playback versus 2G iPod touch 36 Hours music playback -Expensive for the 64GB version.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>-Still no FM radio without the use of online applications -Bluetooth is still half locked Update : one more reason to avoid the 8GB ipod touch, Apple announced today "April 09 2010" that iPhone 4.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>0 OS will be released this summer and it will bring many new features to the iphone and ipod touch, however some features like Multitasking will only be available for iphone 3GS and higher or Ipod touch third generation and higher</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>(As i said before the 8GB is second Generation only, a third generation 8gb ipod touch do not exist!.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>so you wont be getting multitasking if you buy the 8GB ipod touch),</sentcont></sentence>

<freereview><sentence><sentcont>The iPod Touch debuted only one year ago, and this is the first update.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I was excited to pick up the new iPod Touch at the Apple Store because I had never owned a first generation, though I do own iPhones.??I want to concentrate primarily on the new features:??First, physical volume buttons are now placed on the side of the iPod Touch as they are on the iPhone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>This is very convenient.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It allows you to adjust the volume of your music, without having to pull the entire device out of your pocket and activate the screen.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>A time saver.??Second, many people requested a built-in speaker for the iPod Touch like is available on the iPhone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Apple listened.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>However, there is one important point to make on this!</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The iPod Touch is incredibly small, and Apple is forced to put an incredibly small speaker.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The speaker in the iPod Touch sounds worst than the speaker in the iPhone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I have compared it side by side, and it's fairly significant, and the iPhone speaker isn't that great to begin with.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>However, in a quiet room, the speaker is still useful for previewing a song you might want to buy, or for playing games.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>However, still, if you want great sound, you need to connect your headphones.??Genius - This new feature is really surprisingly good.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>When you're listening to a song you enjoy, select the genius option.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It will create a playlist for you, with songs that go together nicely with the one you started with.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It helps you rediscover great music from your collection with a playlist suited to the mood you're in.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I didn't think it would do a good job compiling this list, but it has been quite impressive.??Applications - It's great to have the ability to buy (or get some free) applications right on the iPod Touch.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Furthermore, with the software update this new iPod Touch comes with, the Application installation process is so much smoother than it had been even on my iPhone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It now works how you want it to, seamlessly.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I like having a weather application that includes doppler radar images, and that is free.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I also have several games on it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>There is a great variety of applications available from hundreds of third-parties right on the iPod itself, so you are certain to find something that interests you.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I really like the new release of Spore, for the iPod Touch and iPhone.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Apple is really pushing the games and quietly suggest they are challenging Nintendo and Sony.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>They are innovative and interesting games, but I think they have a ways to go, to challenge those game makers.??Nike + is now built in too, so if you have the shoes and the puck, the iPod Touch is ready to receive the data from it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Battery life is improved to 36 hours audio and 6 hours video according to Apple.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I find the audio number fairly accurate if you don't light up the display much, but the video number is a slight bit harder to achieve.??Of course, the new ipod Touch does look and feel even better than the first generation, from my small experiences with the previous one.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I also think it feels cooler than my iPhones, but obviously your interpretation may very.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I like the metal back on the iPod Touch.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It looks classy, though it is prone to scratches.??One of my favorite features continues to be, when in my home on Wi-Fi, to reach down for the Touch, use Safari web browser and look something up.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's great.??Overall, it was a solid update for the iPod Touch.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I wish the speaker could be better on it, but I believe that is due to the physical restrictions of the small device.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I could have knocked it to four stars for that, but I think most people realize a built in speaker isn't the way you want to listen to most audio on an iPod to begin with.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I'm impressed by the second generation iPod Touch, and I think with the third party applications getting better and becoming more popular, more people will consider the Touch.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>??</sentcont></sentence>

<rating>0.8</rating>
<pro><sentence>
<sentcont> - Thin- 3.5 inch display- Love the WiFi option- Good battery life- Volume buttons on the side are a huge plus </sentcont>
</sentence></pro>
<con><sentence>
<sentcont> - Because its so thin, the iPod Touch does get quite warm at the back- For me, the screen sometimes freezes, but it is an easy fix </sentcont>
</sentence></con>
<freereview><sentence><sentcont>I love the iPod Touch.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Huge screen is perfect for playing games or surfing the web.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I dunno about other cities but now with hot zones all over Toronto, you can basically connect to the internet from anywhere.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Especially perfect for me since I'm a university student and one of my profs dislike laptops because he finds them distracting.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>No problem, take out my iPod Touch and log on, and he can't see it because of its thin size.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Battery life on this is awesome.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It will probably last me a whole week before I need to recharge it.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It's not like I use my iPod rarely.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I actually use it during breaks and going to and from school which amounts to about 4 - 4.5 hours a day.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>One problem I do have with my iPod Touch, and I'm not sure if anyone else has this problem, but most of the time, when I'm listening to my music, my iPod is in my pockets.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>When it's in my pockets, it switches the display from the songs album cover to the album flow option (vertical display to horizontal display).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Sometimes, when I take out my iPod to backtrack on the song, or go to my menu to switch to a specific song, my iPod's screen stays in the horizontal display even when I'm holding it vertically.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I just fix this by pushing to Home button then tapping the music button again.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It can get annoying at times.</sentcont></sentence>

</sentence></pro>
<con><sentence>
<sentcont> There are none </sentcont>
</sentence></con>
<freereview><sentence><sentcont>The good: The second-generation Apple iPod Touch has it all: music, videos, photos, podcasts, e-mail, Web browsing, Internet radio, games, Nike+, Wi-Fi music downloads, and an App Store for adding thousands of custom features.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The bad: The second-generation iPod Touch may be overwhelming to users looking for a simple music player; audio quality is average; and iTunes software is required.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The bottom line: The second-generation iPod Touch includes features that are light-years ahead of the competition, its design has improved, and its price has finally come down to earth.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Specifications: Device type: Digital player ; Flash memory installed: 32 GB; Digital player supported digital audio standards: AAC , MP3 , WAV , AIFF , Audible , Apple Lossless Design Apple's updates to the iPod Touch's design are subtle, but the hardware has definitely changed for the better.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>A slim volume switch now graces the left edge of the Touch, making it easier to make quick volume adjustments.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>The chromed steel back of the second-generation iPod Touch now mimics the rounded design of the iPhone 3G, giving the device a slimmer profile at its edges.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Whether psychological or by design, the second-generation iPod Touch feels less fragile than last year's model and makes the plastic enclosure of the iPhone 3G feel cheap by comparison.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Minor improvements aside, the second-generation iPod Touch hardware is largely unchanged.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Both the first- and second-generation iPod Touch share the same dimensions (4.3 inches by 2.4 inches by 0.31 inch), same glass-covered screen (3.5 inch), and same arrangement of headphone jack, dock connector, sleep button, and home button.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Features Priced at $229 (8GB), $299 (16GB), and $399 (32GB), the second-generation iPod Touch still commands a fairly high price compared with other MP3 players with similar capacities.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>When you weigh the price of the iPod Touch against its features, however, the device becomes much more attractive.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Out of the box, the second-generation iPod Touch includes an amazing music player, podcast support, video playback (including iTunes rentals and a YouTube player).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>a Safari Web browser, photo viewer, an e-mail reader (compatible with Outlook, Exchange, MobileMe, Gmail, Yahoo, AOL, or any POP e-mail service), an integrated Wi-Fi iTunes music store, and a host of smaller utilities (weather, calendar, maps, stocks, notes, voice memos, clock, contacts, and calculator).</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Provided you can become proficient with its touch-screen keyboard, the iPod Touch is more pocket PC than MP3 player.</sentcont></sentence>

(WORK ON THIS, APPLE!)In december of 2008, I was frantically trying to decide which new PDA to get: an iPod touch, or an HP iPaq 111 classic.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>My old device was a Dell Axim x5, so I was familiar with the Windows Mobile Platform.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I was also trying to decide whether my next computer sould be a Wintel or a Mac.I really wanted my next product to tie in with my next computer, and I was buying the PDA first, so it was crunch time - I had to choose.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>Windows Mobile promised me a platform with tons of developers where anyone can make and publish their own program.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It also promised compatibility with Windows Vista/7 and Office 2007/14. the iPod touch, on the other hand, promised unmatched ease of use, Compatibility with Mac and Windows, and a thriving closed dev community where every app would be conveniently located in one place - the App Store.I knew If I bought the Windows Mobile device, I would be locked in with Windows because WinMo devices do not sync with Macs.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>(Yes, I know about MissingSync.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I do not want to pay for the basic capability to sync.)I always loved how all Apple products seemed to tie in with one another - iLife with itself, iTunes and Apple TV, Mac and iPod, Time Capsule and Mac, I chose the iPod and the Mac, and I have to say - I couldn't be happier.I was always really frustrated with how sluggish and complicated Windows Mobile was, and while iPod touch does slow down sometimes, It is much, much faster and way easier to use.Unfortunately</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>mine has developed several deep scratches on the front screen, only visible in direct sunlight but still an annoyance.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>I have bought several cases for it, including the Belkin folio, the LuxMo rubberized case, and hopefully soon the beautiful iSkin Touch vibes case.My iPod has turned out to be a great devide, sepite a few flaws.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>My iPod touch does everything I want it to do whenever I want - perfectly.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It seamlessly integrates with my shiny new Mac to provide a bump-free and easy experience for me.</sentcont></sentence>
<sentence><sentcont>It manages my contacts and calendar, Plays my music and movies, checks the weather, gives me directions, lets me browse my photos, enables me to work on the go by checking old e-mails and browsing the web where there is Wi-Fi, checking Wikipedia, googling, Tweeting, checking movie times, reading books, checking RSS feeds, looking up words in the dictionary, checking my current Wi-Fi speeds, studying my Japanese, helping me go to sleep, fakes calls to get me out of stuff, plays the 32 awesome casual and hardcore games I've bought, is a dice shaker, pulls me down videos from youtube, converts currencies, translates, checks my stocks and a million other things - It is my perfect all in one device.If only it were a phone.</sentcont></sentence>
