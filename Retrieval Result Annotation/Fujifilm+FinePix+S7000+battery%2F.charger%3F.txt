<sentcont> Very nice pink and shiny digital camera, that I purchased for my girlfriend to take on holiday</sentcont>
<sentcont>I was surprised how small the camera is and of course the picture quality is good with a resolution of 12 MP and 4x optical zoom</sentcont>
<sentcont>The 2.7" LCD screen is nice and bright and can be seen in most lighting conditions</sentcont>
<sentcont>The camera uses standard AA batteries, and the battery life seemed very good</sentcont>
<sentcont> One battery lasted a week's holiday</sentcont>

<sentcont> No separate viewfinder, but you rarely find this feature on similarly priced cameras</sentcont>
<sentcont>No case, but you can pick one up fairly cheaply</sentcont>

<sentcont> Styish and colourful appearance, wideangle lens (28mm equiv.) to adequate telephoto, more than enough pixels (12m), easy to handle for point and shoot photos, 2.7" LCD is big enough</sentcont>
<sentcont>AA batteries for convenience as an occasional user</sentcont>
<sentcont>Excellent for the price</sentcont>
</sentence></pro>
<con><sentence>
<sentcont> When using rechargeable AA batteries, the camera seems dead after they are first inserted or after you open the battery/memory card compartment door to get at the card, It's as though the camera needs up to a minute to get its circuits working with rechargables, but switches on instantly with alkaline AAs</sentcont>
<sentcont>Setting the menu option for the correct battery type makes no difference</sentcont>
<sentcont>For more advanced use, where changing camera and flash modes is required, the lack of a command dial slows you down and means you have to delve through various menus to find the setting needed</sentcont>

<sentcont> Excellent capacity and has a lot of features, does HD video as well as standard video and very good panoramic pictures</sentcont>
<sentcont>For all its features and zoom the 2 AA batteries last well, it processes pictures quickly so that you can get another shot in</sentcont>
<sentcont> Like the ability for using the zoom while videoing</sentcont>
<sentcont>The wide angle lens is very good and keeps the fish-eye effect to a minimum (once you go beyond 35mm you will get some fish-eye effect but the better quality lens the less it shows)</sentcont>
<sentcont>Even though as you can see from below I have a few niggles, I DO HIGHLY recommend this camera it is excellent value for money </sentcont>
</sentence></pro>
<con><sentence>
<sentcont> HATE the automatic resetting to "0" of the picture numbers if you remove & switch discs, you can end up with pictures having the same reference number which causes problems for storage and reference</sentcont>
<sentcont>It is a real pain having to scroll through the picture/video options on the view screen at the back to select a picture setting</sentcont>
<sentcont>It takes ages, a simple rotating swtich on the back or top of the camera would have been MUCH better for the prime settings such as switching from still shots to video</sentcont>
<sentcont>panoramic & close up</sentcont>
<sentcont>Would have been more sensible to have a separate access point for changing over the discs & batteries rather than having to use the battery compartment lid cover, this lid does NOT have the strongest hinge and will easily break </sentcont>

<sentcont> I`ve not yet got fully used to the camera due to a lack of leisure time but I`ve been using it more at work lately (surveying building sites etc) and am on a learning curve</sentcont>
<sentcont> There is certainly nothing about the Finepix  that I dislike</sentcont>
<sentcont>I was surprised at it`s versatality in such a compact case</sentcont>
<sentcont>As for `ease of use` I am sure that in due course I will have mastered the many features it offers, the menu buttons require a bit of practice and regular reference to the well thought out user-manual is essential</sentcont>
<sentcont> Picture quality is brilliant and the detail in the pictures is really useful in my line of work and I look forward to capturing holiday pictures</sentcont>
<sentcont>All in all, I have never had such good value for money from a camera, and I`ve been taking pictures since my Kodak Brownie 45 years ago</sentcont>

<sentcont> my daughter took up to 10 pictures that did not colate onto the sd card</sentcont>
<sentcont>this is because you have to wait for the lights to stop flashing before you can take another picture</sentcont>
<sentcont>This is a disadvantage when you want to capture an instantanious moment</sentcont>
<sentcont>Another bad point is that it dose not hold battery power for long and in the sace of 12 hours we went through 6 batterys</sentcont>

<sentcont>It does not suck the battery life dry after 2 pics (like other reviews received from other cams) and it's so sleek and looked 'the gadget'</sentcont>
<sentcont>For the price, I could not have bargained for more</sentcont>

<sentcont> It meets all my requirements for a starter camera</sentcont>
